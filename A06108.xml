            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a principle in natural philoſophy (right Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) that in euerie naturall bodie, as well the Elephant as the gnat, there is ſome propertie or other to be admired and wondred at: and not only in philoſophie, but alſo in Diuinitie; for euen the diuine Singer of Iſrael anoucheth the ſame, when hee ſaith, That the workes of God are wonderfull, and his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments paſt finding out: and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great reaſon; for if we turne ouer euery leafe of Gods creatures from the tenth ſphere to the centre of the earth, we ſhall find, that euery leafe and letter of this great volume, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable and wonderfull: and ſuch as
<pb facs="tcp:1241:3"/> doth not onely demonſtrate a diuine power to ſit at the ſtern of the world, but alſo our owne weaknes, which is not able to comprehend the leaſt part thereof.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F to auoid and eſchew vice, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſaying of the Poet) be a chiefe vertue, and as it were, the firſt degree of wiſdome; then it is a neceſſarie point to know what vice and vertue is, and to diſcerne the euill and good which either of them bring forth, to the end to beware leaſt wee daſh our ſelues vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares againſt vice in ſtead of vertue, and be caught with the deceitfull baites thereof. For this cauſe the great and famous Philoſopher about to lay open the nature of morall vertues (according to that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and light which nature afforded him) conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not himſelfe with a ſimple narration of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, eſſence, and obiect of them, but oppoſed to euery vertue on each ſide the contrarie and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant vice; to the end that at the ſight of them, being ſo out of ſquare, ſo hurtfull and pernicious, vertue it ſelfe might be more amiable and in greater eſteeme. And for this cauſe alſo God himſelfe our ſoueraigne and perfect lawgiuer, that hee might faſhion and fit vs to the mould of true and ſolide vertue, vſeth ofte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner negatiue prohibitions than affirmatiue comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements in his law: to the end aboue all things to diſtract and turne vs from euill, whereunto we are of
<pb facs="tcp:1241:5"/> our ſelues too too much inclined. And as by this meane ſinne is diſcouered and made known vnto vs, ſo is the puniſhment alſo of ſinne ſet before our eyes by thoſe threatnings and curſes which are there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced: to the end, that whome the promiſes of life and ſaluation could not allure and perſuade to do well, them the feare of puniſhment (which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth ſinne as a ſhadow doth the body) might bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and reſtraine from giuing them ouer to impietie. Now then if the very threatnings ought to ſerue for ſuch good vſe, ſhall not the execution and perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of them ſerue much more? to wit, when the tempeſt of Gods wrath is not only denounced, but alſo throwne downe effectually vpon the heads of the mightie ones of the world when they are diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and rebellious againſt God. And hereupon the Prophet ſaith, <hi>That when Gods iudgements are vpon earth, then the inhabitants learne iuſtice.</hi> And doubtleſſe it is moſt true, that euery one ought to reape profit to himſelfe by ſuch examples, as well them which are preſented daily to their view by experience, as them which haue beene done in times paſt, and are by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of hiſtory preſerued from obliuion. And in this regard hiſtorie is accounted a very neceſſary and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable thing, for that in recalling to mind the truth of things paſt, which otherwiſe would be buried in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, it ſetteth before vs ſuch effects (as warnings &amp; admonitions touching good and euill) and laieth vertue and vice ſo naked before our eyes, with the puniſhments or rewards inflicted or beſtowed vpon the followers of each of them, that it may rightly be called, an eaſie and profitable apprentiſhip or ſchoole
<pb facs="tcp:1241:5"/> for euery man to learne to get wiſedome at another mans coſt. Hence it is, that Hiſtorie is tearmed of the ancient Philoſophers, <hi>The record and regiſter of Time, the light of Truth, and the miſtreſse and looking glaſse of mans life.</hi> Inſomuch as vnder the perſon of another man it teacheth and inſtructeth all thoſe that apply their minds vnto it, to gouerne and carry themſelues vertuouſly and honeſtly in this life. Wherefore they deſerue great praiſe and commendation that haue taken paines to enroll and put in writing the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable actes and occurrents of their times to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the ſame to their poſteritie: for there the high and wonderfull workes of God do moſt clearely, and as it were to the view, preſent themſelues; as his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and prouidence: whereby albeit he guideth and directeth eſpecially his owne, to wit, thoſe that in a ſpeciall and ſingular maner worſhip and truſt in him, (as by the ſacred hiſtories touching the ſtate and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the auncient and primitiue Church it may appeare) yet he ceaſeth not for all that to ſtretch the arme of his power ouer all, and to handle and rule the prophane and vnbeleeuing ones at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: for he hath a ſoueraigne empire and predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ouer all the world. And vnto him belongeth the direction and principall conduct of humane mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in ſuch ſort, that nothing in the world commeth to paſſe by chance or aduenture, but onely &amp; alwaies by the preſcription of his wil; according to the which he ordereth &amp; diſpoſeth by a ſtraight and direct mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well the generall as the particular, and that after a ſtrange and admirable order. And this a man may perceiue if he would but marke and conſider the
<pb facs="tcp:1241:6"/> whole body, but eſpecially the end &amp; iſſue of things: wherein the great and marueilous vertues of God, as his bountie, iuſtice, and power, doe moſt clearely ſhine; when hee exalteth and fauoureth ſome, and debaſeth and frowneth vpon others, bleſſeth and proſpereth whome hee pleaſe, and on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, curſeth and deſtroieth whome he pleaſe, and that deſerue it. It is hee alſo which erecteth principalities, and which maintaineth commonwealths, kingdoms, and empires, vntill by the ſumme and weight of their iniquities, they ſinke themſelues into ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. And herein is hee glorified by the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his moſt iuſt and righteous iudgements, when the wicked after the long abuſe of his lenitie, benignitie, and patience, doe receiue the wages and reward of their iniquities. In this (I ſay once againe) ſhineth out the wonderfull and incomprehenſible wiſedome of God, when by the due ordering of things ſo different and ſo many, hee commeth ſtill to one and the ſame marke which hee once preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, to wit, the puniſhment of the world according to their demerits. And this ſame is moſt manifeſt and apparant euen in the hiſtories of prophane writers, albeit in their purpoſe it was neuer intended nor thought vpon, nor yet regarded almoſt of any that read the ſame; men contenting themſelues for the moſt part with the ſimple recitall of the ſtorie, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to take pleaſure and paſſe away time, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting any further matter: Notwithſtanding the true and principall vſe of their writings ought to be, diligently to marke the effects of Gods prouidence and of his iuſtice: thereby to learne to containe our
<pb facs="tcp:1241:6"/> ſelues within the bonds of modeſtie and the feare of God, ſeeing that they which haue carried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues any thing vprightly in equitie, temperance, and other naturall vertues, haue beene in ſome ſort ſpared: and the reſt (bearing the puniſhment of their iniquities) haue fallen into ruine and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>This conſideration ought to perſuade euerie man to turne from euill and to follow that which is good; ſeeing that the Lord ſheweth himſelfe ſo incenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all them which lead a wicked, damnable, and peruerſe life. And this is the cauſe why I hauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the great and horrible puniſhments wherewith the Lord in his moſt righteous iudgement hath ſcourged the world for ſin, according to that which is contained as well in ſacred as prophane hiſtories: hauing gathered them togither and ſorted them one after another in their ſeuerall roomes, according to the diuerſitie of the offences, and order and courſe of time, which as neare as I could I endeauoured to follow: To the end, to lay downe as it were in one table and vnder one aſpect, the great and fearefull iudgements of God vpon them that haue rebelled or repugned his holy will. And this I doe not with purpoſe to comprehend them all, (for that were not onely difficult but impoſſible:) but to lay open the moſt notable and markeable ones that came to my knowledge: to the end, that the moſt wicked, diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and diſordered ſinners, that with looſe raines runne fiercely after their luſt, if the manifeſt tokens of Gods ſeueritie preſented before their eyes, doe not touch them, yet the cloud and multitude of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, through the ſight of the ineuitable anger &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:1241:7"/> vengeance of God vpon euill liuers, might terrifie and ſomewhat curbe them. Periurers, idolatours, blaſphemers, and other ſuch wicked and prophane wretches; with murderers, whoremongers, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, rauiſhers, and tyrants, ſhall here ſee by the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe that hath fallen vpon their likes, that which hangeth before their eies, and is ready to lay hold of them alſo. For albeit for a time they ſleepe in their ſinnes and blindneſſe, delighting in their pleaſures, and taking ſport in cruelties and euill deeds, yet they draw after them the line, wherewith (being more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared than they are aware) they are taken and drawn to their finall deſtruction.</p>
            <p>And this may teach and aduertiſe both thoſe that are not yet obſtinate in their ſinnes, to bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to ſome amendment; and thoſe that feare God already, to ſtrengthen and incourage them in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and continuance in their good courſe. For if God ſhew himſelfe ſo ſeuere a reuenger of their ſins that take pleaſure in diſpleaſing him: there is no doubt, but on the contrary, hee will ſhew himſelfe bountifull, gracious and liberall in rewarding al them according to his promiſe which ſtriue to pleaſe him, and conforme their liues vnto his will. Great and ſmall, yong and old, men and women, and all other of what degree and condition ſoeuer, may here learn at other mens charges, how to gouerne themſelues in duty towards God and betwixt themſelues, by a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vnblameable life in mutuall peace and vnity: and by ſhunning and eſchewing ſinne, againſt the which, God (a moſt iuſt iudge) poureth forth his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, euen vpon the heads of them that are guiltie
<pb facs="tcp:1241:7"/> thereof. Beſide here is ample matter and argument to ſtoppe the monthes of all Epicures and Atheiſts of our age, and to leaue them confounded in their errours, ſeeing that ſuch and ſo many occurrents and puniſhments are manifeſt proofes, that there is a God aboue that guideth the ſterne of the world, and that taketh care of humane matters, and that is iuſt in puniſhing the vniuſt and malicious. Againe, whereas ſo much euill and ſo many ſinnes haue raigned and ſwaied ſo long time, and doe yet raigne and ſway vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, we may behold the huge corruption &amp; peruerſitie of mankind, and the rotten fruits of that wormeaten roote <hi>originall ſinne;</hi> when wee are not directed nor guided by the holy ſpirit of God, but left vnto our owne nature. And hereby true faithfull Chriſtians may take occaſion ſo much the more to acknowledge the great mercy and ſingular fauour of God towards them, in that they being receiued to mercie, are renewed to a better conuerſation of life than others. In briefe, a man may heare learne, (if he be not altogither void of iudgement and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) to haue ſinne in hatred and deteſtation, conſidering the wages and reward thereof: and how the iuſtice of God purſueth it continually, euen to the extreameſt execution, which is both ſharpe and rigorous.</p>
            <p>Touching the word <hi>Iudgement,</hi> I haue imitated the language of holy Scripture, wherein as the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and commaundements of God are called Iudgements, becauſe in them is contained nothing but that which is iuſt, right, and equall: ſo likewiſe the puniſhments inflicted by God vpon the deſpiſers
<pb facs="tcp:1241:8"/> of his commandements are called by the ſame name, as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.6. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.12. &amp; 22.8. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 5.8. &amp; 11.9. and elſewhere, becauſe they alſo are as iuſt as the former, proceeding from none other fountaine ſaue the moſt righteous iudgement of God, whereof none can complaine but vniuſtly.</p>

A miſchiefe to be lamented aboue the reſt, drawing after it an horrible ouerflow of all euils, and like a violent ſtreame ſpoiling euery where as it goeth: when as they that ought to gouerne the ſterne of the Commonwealth let all goe at randome, ſuffering themſelues to bee rocked a ſleepe with the falſe and deceitfull lullabie of effeminate pleaſures and delights of the fleſh; or at leaſt letting themſelues be carried headlong by the tempeſt of their owne ſtrong and furious paſſions, into emminent danger of ſhipwrackes: when as their care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full watchfulneſſe and modeſtie accompanied with the traine of other good and commendable vertues, ought to ſerue them for fails cables, ankers, maſts and skutles, whereby to gouerne and direct the veſſel vvhoſe ſtearſmen they are appointed, and thoſe that are their charge, to whom they ought to giue a good example of life, and be vnto them as it vvere a glaſſe of vertue: for they are ſet aloft as it vvere vpon a ſtage to be gazed at of euerie commer.

And therefore they ought to be carefull to lead an honeſt and vertuous life, that thereby they might perſuade and moue the meaner ſort of people to doe the like: for it is a true ſaying of the Philoſopher, Like Prince, like people: in ſo much, that euerie one deſireth to frame himſelfe according to the humour of his ſuperiour, whoſe will and manners ſerue ſimplie for a law to doe euill: to the which men vſe by taking any occaſion too haſtelie to giue themſelues ouer with too much libertie: whervpon followeth an vnrecouerable ruin, no leſſe then the fall of a great houſe, which for want of pillers and ſupporters that ſhould vphold it, ſuddenly falleth to the ground; ſo this ſhip being depriued of her gouernour,

As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe none leſſe welcome vnto them, then they that tell them of their faults, and contradict them neuer ſo little: for they cannot abide in anie caſe to be reprooued whatſoeuer they doe. And now a daies euerie baſe companion will forſooth ſtorme and fume as ſoon, if he be reproued of a fault, as if he had receiued the greateſt wrong in the world: ſo much is euerie man pleaſed with himſelfe, and puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed vp with his owne vices and fooliſh vanities. And what ſhould a man doe in this caſe? It is as hard to redreſſe theſe great miſchiefs as if we ſhould goe about to ſtop and hinder the courſe of a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſtreame, there where the bancke or cauſey is broken downe: if it

For as for admonitions and warnings, they are not a whit regarded: but they that giue them are derided or laughed to ſcorne or reuiled for their labors. What muſt we therefore do? It is neceſſarie that we aſſay by all means to bring theſe men (if it be poſſible) to ſome modeſtie &amp; fear of God, which if it cannot be done by willing and gentle means, force and violence muſt be vſed, to plucke them out of the fire of Gods wrath, to the end they be not conſumed: if not all yet at leaſt thoſe that are not growne to that height of ſtubbornes, and of whome ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

For euen as when a captaine hath not preuailed by ſummoning a citie to yeeld vp it ſelfe, he by and by pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth his canon againſt their wals, to put them in feare; In like ſort muſt wee bring foorth againſt the prowd and high minded men of this world, an armie of Gods terrible iudgements throwne downe by his mighty and puiſſant hand vpon the wicked, more terrible and fearefull, then all the roaring canons or double canons in the world, vvhereby the moſt prowd are deſtroied and conſumed euen in this life, all their pride and power how great ſoeuer it bee being not able to turne backe the vengeance of God from lighting vpon their heads to their vtter deſtruction and confuſion. As it is manifeſt by infinit examples. Now becauſe that the nature of men is fleſhly and giuen to be touched with things that are preſented before their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or hath beene done before time, it is a more forcible motiue to ſtirre them vp, then that which as yet cannot be made manifeſt, but is to come. Therefore I purpoſe here to ſet downe the great &amp; fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full iudgements, wherewith God hath alreadie plagued manie in this world, eſpecially them of high degree: whoſe example will ſerue for a glaſſe, both for theſe that liue now, or ſhall liue hereafter.

Let anie aduerſitie or affliction light vpon a man of low degree, or vvhich is poore and deſolate, no man conſidereth of it rightly, but talking thereof, men ceaſe not to impute the cauſe of this poore ſoules miſerie either to pouertie or want of ſuccour, or ſome other ſuch like cauſe. Therefore if anie

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow to the end that no man ſhould pretend igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for an excuſe, God hath beſtowed vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one a certaine knowledge and iudgement of good and euill, which being naturally engraued in the tables of mans heart, is commonly called The law of nature: whereby euery mans owne conſcience giueth ſufficient teſtimony vnto it ſelfe, when in his moſt ſecret thoughts it either accuſeth or excuſeth him: for there is not a man liuing, which doth not know in his owne heart, that he doth an euill deed when he wrongeth another, although he had neuer bene inſtructed elſewhere in that point. So although that in <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinius Superbus</hi> time (<hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) there was no written law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in Rome forbidding the rauiſhing and deflouring of wiues and virgines: yet the wicked ſonne of this <hi>Tarquine</hi> was not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leſſe guilty of an hainous crime, when contrary to the law of nature, hee violently robbed <hi>Lucrece</hi> of her chaſtity: for no man can be ignorant that it is a moſt grieuous crime to lay ſiege to the chaſtitie of a maried woman, with ſuch outrage: and ſo the whole people of Rome did eſteeme of it as a crime moſt wicked, ſtrange, and intollerable, and worthy of grieuous puniſhment. Euery man knoweth thus much, that he ought not to do that to another, which he would not another ſhould do to him: which ſentence the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Seuerus</hi> made alwaies to be ſpoken aloud and declared by the ſound of the trumpet, in the way of aduertiſement, as often as puniſhment was taken vpon any offender, as if it were a generall law pertaining to all men. This is that equity &amp; iuſtice, which ought to be ingrafted in our hearts, &amp; wherof nature herſelf is the ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtreſſe: from this fountaine all humane and ciuill lawes are deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: if we had not rather ſay that they are deriued from that true ſpring of equity, which is in the law of God, which law he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for a plaine and familiar manifeſtation of his will, concerning iuſt, holy, and reaſonable things, touching the ſeruice, honour, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1241:14"/> glorie which is due vnto himſelfe, and the mutuall dutie friendſhip and good will, which men owe one to another: whereunto he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth and entiſeth euery one by faire and gratious promiſes, and forbiddeth the contrarie, by great and terrible threatnings, (ſo gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle &amp; mercifull is he towards vs and deſirous of our good.) This is that law which was publiſhed before the face of more then ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand perſons, with the mighty &amp; reſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding noiſe of trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, with earthquake, fire, and ſmoke, &amp; with thunders &amp; lightnings to make men more attentiue to heare &amp; more prepared to receiue it with all humility, feare, &amp; reuerence, &amp; alſo to put them in mind, that if they were diſobedient &amp; rebellious, he wanted no power and ability to puniſh them, for he hath lightning, thunder, &amp; fire, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red inſtruments to execute his iuſt vengeance, which no creature vnder heauen is able to auoid, when by the obſtinat tranſgreſsion of wicked men, he is prouoked to anger and indignation againſt them. This is that holy law which hath ben ſet forth by the Prophets: by the rule whereof all their warnings, exhortings, and reprouings, haue ben ſquared: to this law the onely begotten ſonne of God our ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and redeemer Ieſus Chriſt conformed his moſt holy doctrine; bringing men to the true vſe and obſeruation thereof, from which they had declined, and whereof he is the end, the ſcope, and perfect accompliſhment: ſo that ſo far it is that a Chriſtian man may be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it, and haue it in contempt, that none can be counted and reputed a true Chriſtian, if he frame not his life by the rule thereof, if not fully, yet at leaſt as farforth as he is able: otherwiſe, vvhat a ſhame and reproch is this for men to call themſelues by the name of Gods children, Chriſtians, and Catholicks, and yet to do euery thing clean contrarie to the will of God, to make no reckoning of his law, to lead a diſſolute and diſordered life, and to bee as euill (if not worſe) then the vileſt miſcreants and infidels in the world? God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and requireth that he alone ſhould bee worſhipped and praied vnto; and yet the greater part of the world are idolaters, and full of ſuperſtition, worſhip Images, ſtickes and ſtones, and pray to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures inſtead of the creator. God forbiddeth vs to ſweare by his name in vaine: and yet what is more rife then that? ſo that a man can heare nothing elſe but othes and blaſphemies. Manie for the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1241:14"/> leaſt trifle in the world ſtick not to ſweare &amp; forſweare themſelues. God forbiddeth theft, murther, adulterie, and falſe witneſſe bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and yet nothing ſo common as backbitings, ſlanders, forgeries, falſe reports, whoredomes, couſenings, robberies, extortions, and all manner of enuies and enmities. God hath commanded that we loue our neighbours as our ſelues: but we in ſtead of loue; hate, deſpiſe, and ſeeke to procure the hurt and damage of one another, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding anie thing but our owne peculiar profit and aduantage. Is not this a manifeſt and profeſt diſobedience, and intollerable rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt our maker? What child is there that is not bound to honour and reuerence his father? What ſeruant that is not bound to obey his maiſter, and to doe all that hee ſhall will him? What ſubiect that is not tied in ſubiection to his Prince and Soueraigne? Yet there is not one which will not confeſſe, yea and ſweare too with his mouth, that God is his Lord and father; Which if it bee true, what is then the cauſe, that inſtead of ſeruing and pleaſing him, they doe nothing elſe but diſpleaſe and offend his Maieſtie? Is not this the way to prouoke his wrath, and ſtirre vp his indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them? Is it any maruaile if he be incenſed with anger, if he be armed with reuenge, and ſend abroad his cruell ſcourges vpon the earth to ſtrike and whip it with all? Is it any wonder if he pile vp the wicked ones on heapes, and ſhoot out his reuengefull arrows againſt them, and make them drunken with their owne blood, and make his ſword of iuſtice as ſharpe as a raſor,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.35.</note> to puniſh thoſe rebels that haue rebelled againſt him? For <hi>vengeance is mine</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and belongeth onely vnto me,</hi> whoſoeuer therefore he be that followeth the deſires and concupiſcence of his owne fleſh, and this wicked world, &amp; ſhall lead a life contrarie to the inſtruction and ordinance of the law of God, yea although he neuer heard thereof, yet is he guiltie thereof &amp; worthie to be accurſed; for ſo much as his owne conſcience ought to ſerue for a law vnto himſelfe, by the which hee is condemned in thoſe euill actions which he committeth (euen as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) <hi>all that haue ſinned without the law ſhall likewiſe periſh without the law.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Verie man confeſſeth this to be true, That by how much the more benefits and dignitie hee hath receiued from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, by ſo much is he the more bounden and beholden to him: now it is ſo that Kings and Princes are thoſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom God hath beſtowed more plentifully his gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then vpon any other, whom hee hath made as it were his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants in this world: for he hath extolled and placed them aboue others, and bedecked them with honour, giuing them power &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to rule and raigne, by putting people in ſubiection to them: and therefore ſo much the more are they bound to reacknowledge him againe, to the end to doe him all honour and homage which is required at their hands.<note place="margin">Pſal. 2.11.</note> Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> exhorteth them <hi>to ſerue the Lord euen with reuerence.</hi> This then their high and ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent eſtate, is no priuiledge to exempt them from the ſubiection and obedience which they owe vnto God, whom they ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence aboue all things.<note place="margin">Pſal. 29.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye Princes and high Lords</hi> (ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) <hi>giue you vnto the Lord eternall glorie and ſtrength: giue vnto him glorie due vnto his name: and caſt your ſelues before him to doe him reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi> If they owe ſo much honour vnto God as to their ſoueraine, then ſurely it muſt follow, that they ought to obey his voice, and feare to offend him; and ſo much the rather, becauſe hee is a great deale more ſtrong, and terrible then they, able to cauſe his horrible thunderbolts to tumble vpon their heads, they being not able once to withſtand his puiſſance, but conſtrained very often to tremble thereat. In al that preſcription and ordinance ordained &amp; ſet downe by God concerning the office of Kings,<note place="margin">Deut. 17.15.</note> there is no mention made of any libertie that he giueth them to liue after their owne luſts, and to do euery thing that ſeemeth good in their owne eies: but he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioineth them expreſſely to haue alwaies with them the booke of his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1241:15"/> law, delighteth to read and meditate therein, and thereby to learne to feare and reuerence his name, by obſeruing all the precepts that are contained in that booke. As for ciuill and naturall lawes in ſo much as they are founded vpon equitie and right, (for otherwiſe they were no lawes) therein they are agreeable to, and as it were dependents on the law of God, as is well declared by <hi>Cicero</hi> in the firſt and ſecond booke of his lawes: for euen they alſo condemne theeues, adulterers, murderers, parricides, and ſuch like. If then prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be ſubiect to the law of God, as I am about to ſhew: there is no doubt, but that they are likewiſe ſubiect to thoſe ciuill lawes, by reaſon of the equitie and iuſtice which therein is commended vnto vs. And if (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) the lawes ought to be aboue the prince, not the prince aboue the lawes:<note place="margin">Dial. <hi>4.</hi> ote legibus.</note> it is then moſt manifeſt that the prince is tyed vnto the lawes, euen in ſuch ſort, that without the ſame, the gouernment which he ſwaieth can neuer be lawfull and commendable. And if it be true, that the Magiſtrate is or ought to be a Speaking law, (as it is ſaid) and ought to maintaine the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and credit thereof, by the due and vpright adminiſtration of Iuſtice: for if he did not this, he were a dumb law and without life: How is it poſsible that he ſhould make it of authority &amp; ſorce with others, if he deſpiſeth and tranſgreſſeth it himſelfe? <hi>Dauid</hi> did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer aſſume ſo much to himſelfe, as to deſire to haue liberty to do what he liſted in his kingdom, but willingly ſubmitted himſelfe to that whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1241:16"/> to iuſtifie his fact: but freely confeſſed without any cloake, that he had ſinned. Whereby it appeareth of how ſmall ſtrength and authority their opinion and words be, which thinke or affirme that a prince may diſpence with the lawes at his pleaſure: by this opinion was the mother in law of <hi>Antonius Caracalla</hi> ſeduced; who hauing by her laſciuious and filthy allurements, enticed her ſonne in law to luſt, and loue her, and to deſire her for his wife, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him that he might bring his purpoſe to paſſe, and that it was lawfull enough for him if he would, though for other it was vnlawfull, ſeeing that he was Emperour, and that it belongeth not to him to receiue, but to giue lawes: by which perſwaſion, that braue marriage was concluded and made vp, contrary to the law of nature and nations, and to all honeſtie and vertue. So it was reported how <hi>Cambyſes</hi> tooke his owne ſiſter to wife,<note place="margin">Herod. lib <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> whome not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding a litle after he put to death: which thing being not vſuall then among the Perſians, not daring to enterpriſe it (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he was a moſt wicked man) without the aduiſe of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and counſellers of his realme: hee called them togither, and demaunded whether it was lawfull for him to make ſuch a marriage or no: to whome they anſwered freely, that there was no preſcript law which did allow of it: yet (that they might ſooth him vp, fearing to incurre his diſpleaſure) they ſaid further, that though there was no law to command it, yet ſuch a mighty king as hee, might doe what he pleaſed. In like manner that trencher Philoſopher <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> after that he had told <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great,<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> with a loud voice, that he ought not to feare the penaltie of any law, nor the reproch nor blame of any man, becauſe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed onely to his office to create lawes for all other to liue by, and to preſcribe the limits of lawfull and lawleſſe things; and that it became him beeing a conquerour, to rule like a lord and a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and not to obey any vaine conceit of law whatſoeuer; and that what thing ſoeuer the king did, the ſame was ſacred, iuſt, and lawfull vvithout exception: And by this meanes made his proceedings farre more diſſolute and outragious in many things then euer they were before. <hi>Dion</hi> in the epitome of <hi>Xiphiline,</hi> reporteth how the Emperours were wont to vſurpe this priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be exempted from all lawe, that they might not be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1241:16"/> tied to any neceſſity of doing or leauing vndone any thing, and how in no caſe they would endure to be ſubiect to any written ordinances: the which thing is manifeſt euen in the behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the chiefeſt of them, aſwell in regard of their life and manners, as of the gouernment that they vſed in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths. For firſt of all <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> hauing kept in his owne hand the office of the <hi>Triumuir</hi> ten yeeres (as <hi>Suetonius</hi> teſtifieth) hee alſo vſurped the Tribunes office and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that til his dying day: and likewiſe tooke vpon him the Cenſureſhip, namely the office of correcting and gouerning man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and lawes, if need required: whoſe ſucceſſours (a man may truly ſay for the moſt part) trampled vnder their feete all ſincere and ſacred lawes, by their notorious intemperance, diſſoluteneſſe, and cruelties. And yet for all this there wanted not a paraſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call lawyer, vvho to pleaſe the Emperour his lord and maſter the better, and to vnderprop, and as it vvere ſeele ouer vvith a faire ſhevv that tyrannicall gouernment vſed by other Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, foiſted in this as a lavv amongſt the reſt, <hi>Princeps legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ſolutus eſt,</hi> That the prince was exempted from all law. As for that which they alledge out of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Politiques, maketh nothing to ſet a colour vpon this counterfait: for (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) if there be any man that excelleth ſo in vertue aboue all others, that none is able to compare with him, that man is to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a God amongſt men, to whome no law may be preſcribed, becauſe he is a law vnto himſelfe: all which, I graunt to be true, if that which was preſuppoſed could take place: for where no tranſgreſsion is found, there no law is neceſſary: according as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>The law was not giuen for the iust, but for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust and offenders:</hi> but where is it poſsible to find ſuch a Prince ſo excellent and ſo vertuous, that ſtandeth not in need of ſome law to be ruled by?</p>
               <p>Of the like force and ſtrength is that which is written in the firſt booke of Inſtitutions <hi>tit.</hi> 2. the wordes are theſe, <hi>The Princes pleaſure ſerueth for a law, becauſe the whole bodie of the people hath tranſlated all their authoritie, power, and iuriſdiction vnto him:</hi> this is ſpoken of the Romane Emperours, but vpon
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1241:17"/> the ground of ſo ſlender &amp; ſilly reaſon, that vpon ſo weake a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation it can neuer ſtand: for if it be demanded, whether this action of the people of giuing ouer their right and prerogatiue to their Prince, be vvilling or conſtrained, vvhat anſwere vvill they make? If it be by conſtraint and feare (as it is indeed) vvho will not iudge this vſurping of their libertie vtterly vniuſt and tyrannicall: when one man ſhall arrogate that to himſelfe vvhich pertaineth to manie, yea to the vvhole bodie of the people? And admit that this reaſon vvas effectual: yet the gloſe vpon the place ſaith very notably, That the princes pleaſure may be held for a law ſo far forth as that which pleaſeth him, be iuſt and honeſt: giuing vs to know thus much ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that euerie vvill and pleaſure of a Prince, may not indifferentlie be allowed for a law if it be in an vniuſt and diſhoneſt action, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the rule of good maners. Moreouer it appeareth by the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of many ancient people, and realmes, that Princes had neuer this licenſe giuen them to doe vvhat they liſted: for let them be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo mightie, yea as mighty as <hi>Darius,</hi> vnder vvhoſe raign, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian monarchie was aboliſhed: yet he muſt bee content (according to the law of the Medes and Perſians) not to bee able to infringe that law vvhich vvas by the aduiſe of his Peeres and priuie counſell enacted, and by his owne conſent and authoritie eſtabliſhed: no though for <hi>Daniels</hi> deliuerance ſake vvhom he loued,<note place="margin">Dan. 6.8.</note> he greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired and tooke paines either to diſannull or at leaſt to giue a fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable interpretation of it.</p>
               <p>Such in old time was the cuſtome of the Kings of Aegypt not to follow their owne affections in any actions they vvent about,<note place="margin">Diod. lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> but to be directed by the aduiſe of their laws; for they had not ſo much authoritie as to iudge betwixt man and man, or to leuie ſubſidies and ſuch like by their owne powers: neither to puniſh any man through choler, or any ouerweening conceit, but were alwaies tied to obſerue iuſtice and equitie in all cauſes: neither did it grieue them ſo to doe, being perſuaded that whileſt they obeied their lawes, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could better betide them but good.<note place="margin">Thucyd. lib <hi>1.</hi>

Firſt of all the verie waters of Aegypt being conuerted into blood, proclaimed warre againſt him: then the frogges which couered the face of the earth, climed vp e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to his chamber and bed, and filling euery corner of his land, ſounded him an alarum: next a muſter of lice and gnats, and ſuch other troubleſome and ſtincking creatures ſummoned him to combate: an handfull of embers ſcattered in the aire by <hi>Moſes,</hi> vvere vnto him as the ſtrokes of a ſtone or a ſhaft, which did vvoonderfully disfigure their bodies vvith boiles and moſt noiſome ſcabs: afterward the graſhoppers vvere put in battaile aray againſt him, together with the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, haileſtones, horrible thunders, and lightnings, waſting and ſpoiling, and running vp and downe greeuouſly though his whole land.

Therefore while hee remained in this wretched ſtate, Gods angell puniſhed him in the perſon of his eldeſt ſon, which died ſodainly in one night, together with all the firſt borne of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, wherewithall both he and all his people being greatly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and grieued, at length gaue the Iſraelites not only leaue, but alſo haſted thm to depart: but anone as he ſaw them going, like a man beſtraught, he ran after them again, and purſued them with a mightie armie, vntill God in the meane while opening a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to his children ouerthwart the deepe red ſea, attended him in the midway: where he ſurpriſed and enſnared him, ouerthrew and violently ouerturned the wheeles of his chariots, and put his whole armie to a hurliburly, and that hee might vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him, cauſed the ſea from each ſide to returne to his chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, which drowned and deuoured him and all his armie.

               <p>The Iewes of Inmeſter a towne lying betwixt Calchis &amp; Antioch, being vpon a time celebrating their accuſtomed plaies and feaſts, in the midſt of their iollity, as their vſe is, they contumeliouſly reuiled not onely Chriſtians, but euen Chriſt himſelfe: for they got a Chriſtian child and hung him vpon a croſſe, and after many mocks &amp; taunts, making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues merry at him, they whipt him to death. What grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter villany could there be then this? or wherein could theſe deuils incarnate, ſhew forth their malice more apparantly, then thus, not content once to haue crucified Chriſt the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour of the world, but by imitation to performe it againe, and as it were to make known, that if it were vndone, they would do it? So alſo handled they a boy called <hi>Simeon,</hi> of two yeeres and an halfe old in the yeere of our Lord 1476,<note place="margin">Iob Fincel. lib. <hi>3</hi>

But aboue all, they maſſacred a poore carpenters ſon in Hungary in hatred of Chriſt, whom they falſly ſuppoſed to be a carpenters ſon: for they cut in two all his veines, &amp; ſuckt out his blood with quils. And being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and tortured, they confeſſed that they had done the like at Thirna, 4 yeeres before; &amp; that they could not be without Chriſtian blood, for therwithall they anointed their prieſts. But at all theſe times they ſuffered iuſt puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1241:31"/> being ſtill taken, they were either hanged, burned, murdred, or put to ſome other cruell death, at the diſcretion of the magiſtrates. Moreouer, they would at diuers times buy the holy hoſt of ſome popiſh prieſt, and thruſt it through with their kniues, and vſe it moſt deſpitefully: this did one <hi>Eleazarus</hi> in the yere of our Lord 1492, the 22 of October, but was burnt for his labour: And eight and thirty at another time for the ſame villany, by the Marqueſſe <hi>Ioachinus:</hi> for the caitiues would ſuffer themſelues to bee baptized for none other end, but more ſecurely to exerciſe their vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies.</p>

               <p>In the yeere of our Lord 1527, there was one <hi>George Hala</hi> a Saxon, miniſter of the word and ſacraments,<note place="margin">Luther.</note> and a ſtout profeſſour of the reformed religion, who being for that cauſe ſent for to appeare before the Archbiſhop of Mentz at Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaffenburge, was handled on this faſhion: they tooke away his owne horſe, and ſet him vpon the Archbiſhops fooles horſe, and ſo ſent him backe homewards, conducted by one appointed for the purpoſe, who not ſuffering him to ride the common and beaten way, but leading him a new courſe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough by and vncoth pathes, brought him into an ambuſh of theeues placed there by the biſhops appointment, who ſet vpon him and murdred him at once; but it is notoriouſly knowen, that not one of that wicked rable came to a good end, but were conſumed one after another.</p>
               <p>In a city of Scotland called Fanum Ianius, the chiefe mart towne of that countrey, foure of the chiefeſt citizens were accuſed by a monke before the Cardinall, for interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

Now as they went to execution, their wiues fell downe at the Cardinals feete, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching and intreating pardon for their husbands liues: which he was ſo farre from graunting, that hee accuſed them alſo of hereſie: and eſpecially one of them (whoſe name was <hi>Helene</hi>) for hee cauſed her young infant to be pulled out of her armes, and her to be put to death with her husband, for ſpeaking certaine words againſt the virgine <hi>Mary,</hi> which by no teſtimonies could be prooued againſt her. Which doome the godly woman taking cheerefully, and deſiring to hang by her husbands ſide, they would not doe her that laſt fauour, but drowned her in a riuer running by, that it might truly be ſaid, that no jot of mercy or compaſsion remained in them. But ere long the cruell Cardinall found as little ſauour at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other butchers hands that ſlue him in his chamber when hee dreamed of nothing leſſe, and in his Cardinals robes hanged him ouer the wall to the view of men. And thus God reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the death of thoſe innocents, whoſe bloods neuer cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed crying for vengeance againſt their murder, vntill he had juſtly puniſhed him in the ſame kind, and after the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion which he had dealt with them.</p>

By this it appeareth that there are three kinds of apoſtaſie: one as it were enforced and compelled, the ſecond volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the laſt both voluntary and malicious: which though they be all very hainous and offenſiue in the ſight of God; yet the ſecond and third ſort are moſt dangerous, &amp; of them alſo one more hurtfull and pernicious then the other, as wee ſhall perceiue by that which followeth.

And firſt of thoſe which haue fallen away through feare and infirmitie, and afterward in order of the reſt. Although that they who by the conceit and feare of tortures preſented before their eies, or of ſpeedy and cruell death threatned againſt them, do decline and ſlide backe from the profeſsion of the Goſpell, may pretend for excuſe the weakeneſſe and feeblenes of the fleſh, yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they are found guiltie before the throne of God, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetting the loue of this tranſitorie and temporarie life before the zeale of his glorie, and the honor which is due to his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten ſonne, eſpecially at that time when they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of purpoſe by their Martyrdome to witneſſe his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred truth before man, and he deſireth moſt to bee glorified by their free and conſtant perſeuerance therin: to the which perſeuerance they are exhorted by many faire promiſes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life and happineſſe: and from the contrarie terrefied by threats of death and confuſion, and vpon paine to bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the preſence of Chriſt before God, becauſe they haue denied him here before men: which is the miſerie of al miſeries, &amp; the greateſt that can happen to any man; for what
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1241:39"/> ſhall become of that man whome the ſonne of God dooth not acknowledge? Now to prooue that God is indeed high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended at this fainthearted cowardlineſſe, hee himſelfe hath made knowne vnto vs by the puniſhments vvhich di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe times hee hath ſent vpon the heades of ſuch offenders. As in the time of the Emperour <hi>Valerian</hi> the eighth perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor of the church, vnder whoſe perſecution albeit that many champions beſtirred themſelues moſt valiantly in that combate of faith, yet there wanted not ſome whoſe hearts failing them, and who in ſteed of maintaining and ſtanding for their cauſe to the death, as they ought haue done, retired and gaue vp the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to the enemie at firſt aſſault.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1241:42"/> And as his renowne was great and famous before for building that ſumptuous and beautifull temple at Ieruſalem: ſo was his obloquy and reproch the greater for erecting altars and chappels, for the idols of his wiues and concubines, euen for euery one of their idols, to the intent to flatter and pleaſe their humors: it was therefore iuſt and equall that the Lord (his wrath being proueked againſt him) raiſed vp two ſtrong enemies that wrought him and his people much ſcath. Yea moreouer <hi>Ieroboam</hi> one of his owne ſeruants (whileſt he yet liued) was by the ordinance of God deſigned king ouer ten tribes, &amp; ſo God puniſhed him for his idolatry &amp; backſliding, leauing him but a ſmall portion of the kingdome to continue to his ſucceſſors: which had it not been for his father <hi>Dauids</hi> ſake had ben alſo taken away. It is true that we read not that he euer hindred the ſeruice of the temple, or compelled or perſuaded any man to worſhip an idol: yet he did enough to make him culpable before God of a greeuous ſin, in that hee being the head &amp; ſoueraign magiſtrat of the people, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch wickednes &amp; ſuch Apoſtaſie in Iſraell: beſide it is a maruellous ſtrange thing that in all his hiſtorie there is not ſo much as any token mentioned, or to be gathered, of his true repentance after this notable fall. And he that wel weigheth the nature &amp; quality of this ſin ſhal perceiue it that ſome what reſembleth that which is ſpoken of in the 6. cha. to the Heb. ver. 4, 5, 6, for <hi>Salomon</hi> was not ſo ignorant and deſtitute of the knowledge of God, but rather had the treaſure of wiſedome in fulneſſe and abundance, and was endowed with the gifts and graces of Gods ſpirit, that hee was able to inſtruct others and to diſcharge a Doctors place in the church, as hee alſo did both by word and writing. And although that the ſonne of God was not as then yet manifeſted in the fleſh: yet the power and efficacie of his death being euerlaſting, and from the beginning, whereof the law with the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and ſacrifices thereof was as it were a ſchoolemai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, could not bee hidden from him: therefore ſo ſoone as hee adicted himſelfe to his Idolatrie, hee foorthwith
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1241:43"/> abandoned the holy ordinances and ſacrifices of Gods law, and quitted himſelfe of the promiſe of ſaluation therin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, diſanulling and making of none effect as concerning himſelfe, the grace of the mediator ordained from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, ſo that his downefall was terrible and perillous: yet there be that thinke that after all this he wrote the booke of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> as a declaration of his repentance, whoſe opinion I purpoſe not to contradict.</p>

And this was the firſt ſhake that euer this kingdome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued ſince it was a kingdome, whereby it began to waine and decline: Notwithſtanding all this, yet the Lord had compaſsion and pittie of him and his people: and would not ſuffer his dignitie to bee troden vnder foote and quite ſuppreſſed, but reſtored him once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into an honourable eſtate, becauſe when hee was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by <hi>Semeia</hi> the Prophet, he humbled himſelfe before
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1241:43"/> the Lord, and his Princes alſo: which is a manifeſt ſigne that his ſinne was not an vniuerſall Apoſtaſie, whereby hee was wholly turned aſide from God and all hope of grace, as his father <hi>Salomon</hi> was; but it was a particular reuolt, ſuch as was that of his forefathers, the children of Iſrael, when they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined that God would be preſent with them in the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous golden calfe, and in that figure to worſhip him; ſo groſſe and ſenceleſſe were they: although yet <hi>Roboams</hi> ſinne ſeemeth to exceed theirs in greatneſſe and guiltineſſe.

                  <hi>Mahomet,</hi> by birth an Arabian, and by profeſsion one of the moſt monſtrous heretikes that euer liued, began his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie in the yeere 625, his offſpring was but out of a baſe ſtocke: for being fatherleſſe, one <hi>Abdemonoples</hi> a man of the houſe of <hi>Iſmael,</hi> bought him for his ſlaue, and loued him greatly for his fauour and wit: for which cauſe, he made him

Now in the meane while one <hi>Sergius</hi> a monke, (flying for hereſie into Arabia) inſtructed him in the hereſie of <hi>Neſtorius:</hi> a while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, his maſter died without children, and left behind him much riches, and his wife a widow of fifty yeeres of age, whome <hi>Mahomet</hi> married; and when ſhee died, was made heire vnto all her riches. So that now (what for his wealth and cunning in magicke) he was had in high honour among the common people. Wherefore (by the counſell of <hi>Sergius</hi>) he called himſelfe, The great Prophet of God. And ſhortly after (when his fame was publiſhed) hee deuiſed a law and kind of religion called <hi>Alcaron,</hi> wherein he borrowed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing almoſt of all the hereſies that were before his time: with the Sabellians he denied the Trinitie: with the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clies he ſaid there was but two perſons in the Deity: hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the equalitie of the Father with the Sonne, with <hi>Euno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius:</hi> and ſaid with <hi>Macedone,</hi> that the Holy Ghoſt was a creature: and approoued the community of women, with the Nicholaits: hee borrowed of the Iewes circumciſion, and of the Gentiles much ſuperſtition: and ſomewhat he tooke of the Chriſtian verity, beſides many deuiliſh fantaſies inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his owne braine: thoſe that obeied his law, he called <hi>Sarazins.</hi> Now after he had liued in theſe monſtrous abuſes fourty yeeres, the Lord cut him off by the falling ſickneſſe, which he had diſſembled a long time, ſaying when hee was taken therewith, that the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> appeared vnto him, whoſe brightneſſe hee could not behold; but the Lord made that his deſtruction, which he imagined would be for his honour, and ſetting forth his ſect.</p>

In the yeere of our Lord 1561, and the third yere of the reigne of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> there was in London one <hi>William Geffery</hi> that conſtantly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouched a companion of his, called <hi>Iohn Moore,</hi> to be Chriſt our Sauiour, and could not be reclaimed from this mad per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,

Then <hi>Coppinger</hi> anſwered, it ſhould be don forthwith: &amp; therupon (like mad men) he &amp; <hi>Arthington</hi> ran into the ſtreets, &amp; proclaimed their meſſage aforeſaid, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by reaſon of the concourſe of people they could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed any further, they got vp into two empty carts in Cheap, crying, <hi>Repent, repent, for Chriſt Ieſus is come to iudge the world:</hi> &amp; then pulling a paper out of his boſom, he read out of it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things touching the office &amp; calling of <hi>Hacket,</hi> how he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented Chriſt by partaking part of his glorified body, &amp;c. beſides, they called themſelues his prophets, one of Iuſtice, another of mercy. And thus theſe ſimple men were ſtrangely deceiued by a miraculous illuſion of Satan, who no doubt by ſtrange apparitions had brought them into this vain conceit. But let vs obſerue the end of it, it was thus: The whole citie being in a maze, tooke <hi>Hacket</hi> the breeder of this deuiſe,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1241:58"/> and arraigning him before the Maior &amp; other Iuſtices, found him guilty as well of this ſeditious practiſe, as of ſpeaking traiterous words againſt the Queene: Wherefore hee was ſhortly after hanged on a gibbet in Cheape-ſide, counterfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to his laſt, his old deuiſes, and at length vttering horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blaſphemies againſt the maieſtie of God. As for his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>Coppinger</hi> died the next day in Bridewell, and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington</hi> was kept in priſon vpon hope of repentance.

Moreouer alſo towards the end of his ſermons hee commanded to be brought vnto him their cheſtbords, cards, dice, nine pinnes, &amp; ſuch other traſh, which hee openly threw into the fire to be burned before them all: and that he might giue more ſtrength and credite to this his paltrie riffraffe hee cauſed the men and women to bee deuided on ech ſide with a line drawne betwixt them as in a tennis court: and by this meanes hee drew together ſometimes twenty thouſand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: ſo readie and zealous, is and euer hath beene the world to follow after ſuch hypocriticall deceiuers, rather then the true preachers of Gods word.</p>
               <p>But let vs hear the iſſue of this holy hypocrit, it was thus, when hee had in the forenamed ſort trauerſed aſwell France and Flanders; it took him in the head to paſſe the mountains and viſit Rome: imagining that it was no hard matter to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Popeſhip, ſeeing that in all places where hee went there was equall honour giuen vnto him: or if hee ſhould faile of that hope, yet at leaſt the Pope and his cardinals would entertaine him honourably: but it happened far ſhorr of his expectation, for Popes are not ſo prodigall of their honors to do any ſuch reuerence to a poore ſilly Monke, but are very niggards and ſparing thereof euen towards Kings; ſo farre are they from leauing their thrones of maieſty to any other: neither muſt wee thinke that the Pope cared greatly for all thoſe tricks and quiddities of Frier <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſeeing hee himſelfe is the onely Marchant of ſuch traſh. When hee
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1241:60"/> was arriued at Rome, Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> ſeeing that hee came not according to cuſtome to kiſſe his holineſſe feet, ſent for him twiſe, and vnderſtanding that he refuſed to come, and that hee fained himſelfe to bee euill at eaſe: ſent his treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, but not to impart to him any treaſure, but to apprehend and attach him. The Frier now perceiuing that inquirie was made for him, and that they were at his chamber dore, leapt out at a window thinking by that meanes to eſcape: but hee was quickly taken priſoner by the treaſurers ſeruants waiting before the dore, and brought before the conſiſtorie of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals: law proceeded againſt him, by doome wherof though no erronious opinions could bee proued againſt him, hee was adiudged to the ſtake to bee burned for an Heretike: but it was ſufficient to make him guiltie, becauſe hee defamed the Prieſts in his ſermons, and had ſpoken ſo broadly of their goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſips, and had beene ſo bold to vſurpe the authority of giuing pardons, which the Popes claim for a priuiledge of their own ſea, and beſides had made no more account of him that is a pettie God on earth: but had done all theſe things without his leaue and licenſe: it was an hard matter to bee induced of the biſhops of Rome that a ſilly Monke ſhould ſo intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with their affaires, and ſhould derogate any whit from their ſupremacie: ſeeing that they quit themſelues ſo wel with Kings and Emperours, and can at euery right occaſion make them ſtoope: neither is it to be doubted, but that Pope <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius</hi> was very iealous of the honour which Frier <hi>Thomas</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vnto in euery place, &amp; fearfull leaſt his preſence might diſturbe his preſent eſtate. By this meanes God who vſeth all inſtruments for his owne purpoſe, and can direct euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to the performing of his will, did puniſh and correct the hypocriſie of this Monke, that ſeemed to bee holy and wiſe being indeed nothing but fooliſh, ſtubborne and ambitious.</p>
               <p>Moreouer moſt notable was the hypocriſie of two counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait holy maids,<note place="margin">Stow. chron.</note> one of Kent in England called <hi>Elizabeth Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> the other of France called <hi>Ioane la Pucelle:</hi> the former of which by the procurement &amp; information of one <hi>Richard

Howbeit not content to delude the people, ſhee began alſo to medle with the king himſelf, <hi>Henry</hi> the eigth: ſaying that if he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to be deuorced from his wife Queene <hi>Katharine</hi> he ſhould not remaine king one month after, and in the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God not one day: for which &amp; many other tricks pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by her, ſhee with her complices was arraigned of high treaſon, and after confeſsion of all her knauerie, drawne from the tower to Tiborne and there hanged; the holy maides head being ſet vpon London bridge, &amp; the others on certain gates of the city.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Stow. chron.</note>The other named <hi>la Pucelle de dieu,</hi> maruellouſly delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with her counterfeit hipocriſie, <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeuenth king of France, and al the whole French nation in ſuch ſort that ſo much credit was attributed vnto her, that ſhe was honoured as a ſaint, and thought to bee ſent of God to the aid of the French king: by her meanes Orleance was won from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, and many other exploits atchieued, which (to be ſhort) I will refer the reader vnto in the French Chronicles, where they ſhall find her admirable knauerie at large diſcouered. But touching her end it was on this ſort: as ſhee marched on horſebacke to the town of Champaigne, to remoue the ſiege
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1241:61"/> wherewith it was girt by the Duke of Burgoine and other of the Engliſh captaines, Sir <hi>Iohn Leupembrough</hi> a Burgonian knight took her aliue, and conueied her to the city of Roane, where ſhe faining her ſelf with child, when the contrarie was knowne, was condemned and burnt. And thus theſe two ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly women that in a diuerſe kind mocked the people of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland and France by their hypocriſie, by the iuſtice of God came to deſerued deſtructions.</p>

               <p>There was a coniurer at Saltzbourg, that vaunted that he could gather togither all the ſerpents within halfe a mile round about into a ditch, and feed them and bring them vp there: and being about the experiment, behold the old and grand ſerpent came in the while, which whilſt he thought by the force of his charmes to make to enter into the ditch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, he ſet vpon, and encloſed him round about like a girdle ſo ſtrongly, that he drew him perforce into the ditch with him, where he miſerably died.

               <p>It was a very lamentable ſpectacle that chanced to the gouernour of Maſcon, a magitian whome the deuill ſnatched vp in dinner while, and hoiſted aloft, carrying him three times about the towne of Maſcon in the preſence of many beholders, to whome hee cryed on this manner, Helpe, helpe, my friends:<note place="margin">Hugo de Clam.</note> ſo that the whole towne ſtood amazed thereat, yea and the remembrance of this ſtrange accident, ſticketh at this day faſt in the minds of all the inhabitants of the countrey: and they ſay, that this wretch hauing giuen

               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn Francis Picus</hi> of Mirand ſaith, that hee conferred di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers times with many, who being enticed with a vaine hope of knowing things to come, were afterwards ſo grieuouſly tormented by the deuill (with whome they had made ſome bargaine) that they thought themſelues thriſe happy, if they eſcaped with their liues.

Now it chanced that as this Lord of Orne was of moſt wicked and cruell conditions, ſo he had an euil fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red looke anſwerable to his inclination, and name to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurer: the report that went of his cruelty was this; that vpon a time he put the baker (one of his ſeruants, whoſe wife he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſecretly to entertaine) into a tunne, which he cauſed to be rouled from the top of a hill into the bottome, bounſing ſome times as high as a pike, as the place gaue occaſion: but by the great mercy of God, notwithſtanding all this, this poore man ſaued his life. Furthermore, it was a common report that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any Gentlemen or Lords came to ſee him, they were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained (as they thought) very honorably being ſerued with al ſort of moſt dainty fare and exquiſite diſhes, as if hee had not ſpared to make them the beſt cheare that might bee: but at their departure they that thought themſelues wel refreſhed, found their ſtomacks empty &amp; almoſt pined for want of food, hauing neither eaten nor drunk any thing ſaue in imagination only: &amp; it is to bee thought that their horſes found no better fare then their maſters. It happened one day that a certaine Lord being departed from his houſe, one of his men hauing left ſomething behind returned to the caſtle, &amp; entering ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly into the hal where they dined a little before, he eſpied a Munkie beating the maiſter of the houſe that had feaſted them of late, very ſore: And there be others that ſay that hee hath ben ſeene through the chinke of a dore lying on a table vpon his belly all at length, &amp; a Monkie ſcourging him verie
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:1241:65"/> ſtrangely, to whome he ſhould ſay, Let me alone, let me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; Wilt thou alwaies torment me thus?

It happened as he warred in India, he receiued ſo ſore a wound, that with paine thereof hee was conſtrained to ſay, Though he was the renowmed ſonne of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> yet hee ceaſed not to feele the infirmities of a weak &amp; diſeaſed body: finally, being returned to Babylon, where many embaſſadors
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:1241:70"/> of diuerſe farre countries, as of Carthage, and other cities in Affrica, Spaine, France, Sicilie, Sardinia, and certaine Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Italy, were arriued, to congratulate his good ſucceſſe, for the great renown which by his worthy deeds he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; as he lay there taking his reſt many daies, and bathing himſelfe in all kind of pleaſure, one day after a great feaſt that laſted a whole day and a night, in a banket after ſupper being ready to returne home, he was poyſoned; when before he had drunke his whole draught hee gaue a deepe ſigh ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, as if he had beene thruſt through with a dart, and was carried away in a ſowne, vexed with ſuch horrible torment, that had he not beene reſtrained he would haue killed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And on this manner he that could not content himſelfe with the condition of a man, but would needs clymbe aboue the clouds to goe in equipage with God, drunke vp his owne death, leauing as ſodainly all his worldly pompe, as he had ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly gotten it: which vaniſhed like ſmoke, none of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being any whit the better by it.</p>
               <p>There was in Siracuſa a city of Sicilia (which is now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Saragoſſe) a Phiſition called <hi>Menecrates,</hi> whoſe folly and preſumption was ſo great that hee accounted himſelfe a god: and deſired to bee ſo reputed by others: inſomuch that he required no other wages and recompence of the patients which hee tooke in hand (as <hi>Aelianus</hi> witneſſeth) but that they ſhould onely acknowledge him to bee <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and call him ſo, &amp; auow themſelues to his ſeruice. Vpon a time <hi>Denis</hi> the tyrant deſirous to make ſome paſtime with him, made a feaſt and inuited him amongſt others to be his gueſt: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was a god, to do him honor anſwerable to his name, hee placed him a table all alone, and ſet before him no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, but onely a cenſer with frankincenſe, which was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and conuenient ſeruice for the gods: this honourable du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie pleaſed the Phiſitian very wel at the firſt, ſo that he ſnuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed vp the perfume moſt willinglie: but when this poore god ſaw the other gueſts eating and drinking indeed, and himſelfe not being able to bee fed with ſmoke, readie to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:1241:71"/> ſtarue with hunger roſe vp and went away all enraged in himſelfe, and derided of others, hauing more need to purge his owne braine from their ſuperfluous humor, then others from their ſickneſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caligula</hi> the firſt Emperour, being become an ordinarie deſpiſer and open mocker of all religion, it came preſentlie in his braine to beleeue (ſo drunken was hee with a draught of his owne fooliſh conceit) that there was no other God but himſelfe: therefore he cauſed men to worſhip him, &amp; to kiſſe his hands or his feet in token of reuerence, (which honor afterwards the Popes tooke vnto them) yea and was ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted, that he went about by certaine engines of art to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit thunder and lightnings: albeit in all this pride and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancie or rather folly, there was none ſo timorous and fearefull as he, or that would ſooner vpon lighter occaſion be diſmaied. One day as he was by mount Aetna in Cicilie hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by chance the violent cracking of the flames which all that ſeaſon aſcended out of the top of the hill, it ſtroke ſo ſoddaine and horrible a feare into him, that he neuer ceaſed flying all night till hee came to Phar in Meſsina. Euery little thunderclap put him in feare of death, for hee would leape vp and downe like a mad man when hee heard it thunder, finding himſelfe not able by all his godhead to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from the power thereof: but if there chanced greater crackes then ordinarie, then would not his whote bed hold him, but needes muſt he run into the cold floure vnderneath the bed to hide himſelfe. Thus was hee compelled againſt his will to feare him, whome willinglie hee would not deigne to acknowledge. And thus it falleth out with all wicked miſerable Atheiſts whoſe hearts imagine there is no God: and therfore haue ſo little aſſurance in themſelues, that there need no thunder and lightning to amaſe them: for the ſhaking of euerie leafe, is ſufficient to make them tremble. To conclude, this Atheiſt void of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and feare of God, and full of all prophaneſſe, was according to his due deſert murthered by one of his owne

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S touching voluptuous Epicures and curſed Atheiſts, that deny the prouidence of God, beleeue not the immortality of the ſoule, think there is no ſuch thing as life to come, and conſequently impugne all diuinity, liuing in this world like brute beaſts, &amp; like dogs and ſwine, wallowing in all ſenſuality; they do alſo ſtrike themſelues againſt this commandement, by going about to wipe out and deface the knowledge of God, and if it were poſsible, to extinguiſh his very eſſence; wherein they ſhew themſelues more then mad, and brutiſh, whereas not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the euident teſtimonies of the vertue, boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wiſedome, and eternall power of God, which they daily ſee with their eies, and feele in themſelues, doe neuertheleſſe ſtriue to quench his light of nature which enlightneth and perſuadeth them and all Nations of this, There is a God, by <hi>whom we liue, moue, and haue our being;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts. 17.28.</note> who although in his eſſence is inuiſible, yet maketh he himſelfe knowne and as it were ſeene by his workes and creatures, and mighty gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the world, that he that would ſeeke after him, may (as one might ſay) handle and feele him. Therefore they that would perſuade themſelues that this glorious heauen &amp; maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy earth wanted a guider and a gouernour, haue their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding blinded from ſight of things manifeſt, &amp; their hearts peruerted from all ſhew of reaſon: for is there any ſubſtance of this world that hath no cauſe of his ſubſiſting? Is there a day without a ſonne? Are there fruits and no trees? Plants and no ſeeds? Can it raine without a cloud? Bee a tempeſt without wind? Can a ſhip ſaile without a Pilote? Or a houſe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1241:75"/> be built without a carpenter or builder? If then euery part of this world hath his particular cauſe of being and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, is it likely that the whole is without cauſe to bee to it a furniſhing and gouernement? Say you hogges and dogges doe you not beleeue that which you ſee: or if your eies bee bored out that you cannot ſee, muſt you thinke there is no ſonne nor light, becauſe your eies are in darkneſſe and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes? Can you behold all the ſecrets of nature? Is there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a voice, a ſinging of birds, or an harmonious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort of muſicall inſtruments in the world? And yet who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth theſe ſmall things? Can you behold the wind? Can you ſee the ſweet ſmell of fragrant flowers along the fields? Can you ſee the ſecrets of your owne bodies, your entrals, your heart and your brain? And yet you ceaſe not to beleeue that there are ſuch things, except you be heartleſſe &amp; braine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe indeed: Why then doe you meaſure God by your own fight, &amp; do not beleeue there is a God becauſe he is inuiſible, ſince that hee manifeſteth himſelfe more apparently both to vnderſtanding &amp; ſence then either voice, ſmell, or wind? doe not your owne othes blaſphemies and horrible curſings bear witneſſe againſt you, when you ſweare by, deſpight and mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre him whom you deny to be? doth not euery thunderclap conſtraine you to tremble at the blaſt of his voice: if any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity approch neere vnto or light vpon you, or if death bee threatened or ſet before your eies, doe you not then feele in ſpight of all your reaſon, that the ſeuere iudgement of God doth waken vp your dull &amp; ſleepy conſcience to come to his triall? There was neuer yet any nation or people ſo harbarous which by the perſuaſion and inſtinct of nature hath not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies beleeued a certain diety, and to thinke otherwiſe is not only a deteſtable thing, but alſo moſt abſurd &amp; ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to humane reaſon, that the very Paynims haue very little tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated ſuch horrible blaſphemie.

How much more then is the ſtate of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome at this day to bee lamented, which wee ſee in many places infected with ſuch a contagious peſtilence, that diuers men inuenomed with this deadly poyſon, are ſo miſchieuous and wretched as to make roome for Atheiſme, by forbidding and hindering by all means poſsible the courſe of the goſpel: wherein they make knowne what they are and what zeale they bear to the religion &amp; ſeruice of God, &amp; with what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection they are led towards the good &amp; ſafety of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and what hereafter is to be hoped of them: for where there is no knowledge nor fear of God, there alſo is no bridle nor bond to reſtraine and hold men backe from doing euill: wherevpon they grow to that paſſe to be moſt inſolent and prophane. This is the diuinity and goodly inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that commeth beyond the mountaines from that ſcientificall V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſitie and Colledge of the right reuerend maiſters, and from the excellent holineſſe of ſome of their Popes: whoſe manner of life is ſo diſſolute, laſciuious, diſhoneſt and Sarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napal like,<note place="margin">Vide lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>20.</hi> Lucian. Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phory, Iulian. &amp;c Bale.</note> that thereby their Atheiſme is euidently and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly knowne and talked of by euery one.</p>
               <p>Hereof Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth a Florentine by birth, may ſerue for an example: who as he was a very effeminate perſon, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to all manner of delights and pleaſure, hauing no other care but of himſelfe, and his owne filthie carcaſſes eaſe; ſo had hee no more taſt at all nor feeling of God and his holy word, then a dog: hee made the promiſes and threats contained in holy ſcripture, and all elſe that we beleeue, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to laugh at, and things friuolous and of no waight, moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at the ſimplicitie, the faith and beleefe of Chriſtians: for one day when Cardinall <hi>Bembus</hi> (who alſo ſhewed himſelfe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1241:76"/> to bee none of the beſt Chriſtians in the world, by his Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian hyſtorie, where as oft as hee ſpeaketh of God hee vſeth the plurall number after the manner of Heathen wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) alleadged a place out of the Goſpell, his damnable impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie was ſo great as to replie, That this fable of Chriſt had brought to him and ſuch as hee, no little profite. Oh ſtincking and curſed throat to belch out ſuch monſtrous blaſphemie! doe not theſe ſpeeches bewray a villanous and abhominable Atheiſt, if euer any were? Is not this to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelfe openlie to bee Antichriſt? For hee is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt which denieth Ieſus to bee Chriſt, and which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth <hi>the Father and the Sonne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Iohn 2.22.</note> according as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth. Albeit in the meane while this curſed caitife that had as much religion as a dog, made ſhew to bee the protector and defendor of the Catholicke faith, making warre with all his power againſt Chriſt Ieſus in the perſon of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant <hi>Luther.</hi> Now after hee had by his pardons and indulgences drawne out a world of money, and heaped vp great treaſures by the maintenance of courtizans and Whores, and had enriched his baſtards, one day being at meat hee receiued newes of the ouerthrow of the French in Lumbardie, whereat hee reioiced out of meaſure, and for that good tidings doubled his good cheare: ſodainely hee was conſtrained to turne his coppie from ioy into ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, from pleaſure into griefe and gnaſhing of teeth, by a moſt bitter and vnlooked for death which depriued him at once of all his pleaſures, to make him drinke the cup of Gods fierce wrath, and to throw him down headlong into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting paines and torments which were prouided for him. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Martin</hi> of Belay in his ſecond book of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable things) hearing of the great loſſe which the French men ſuſtained at Millan tooke ſo great ioy thereat, that a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar and an ague inſuing, killed him within three daies after: a happie man indeed to die with ioy. Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the third was one of the ſame ſtampe,<note place="margin">Bale. Veag.</note> nothing inferiour to the former in all manner of diſſolute and infamous liuing and vile and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1241:76"/> curſed talke, making knowne by his impietie, that hee had none other God but his belly,<note place="margin">Vide lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>21.</hi> Hereſie.</note> and that hee was none of Chriſts fold but one of Epicures crew; hee was ſuch a glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and ſo paſsionate in his luſts, and ſo prophane a deſpiſer of God and his word, that once at ſupper being enraged &amp; blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming becauſe they had not ſerued in a cold pecock which he commanded to bee kept whole at dinner, though there were other hote on the table, a Cardinal that was preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him not to be ſo moued for ſo ſmall a trifle: What (quoth he) if it pleaſed God to bee ſo angry for eating of an apple as to thruſt <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> out of Paradiſe, ſhould not I which am his vicar be angrie for a pecocke, which is far more worth then any apple? See how this wicked wretch prophaned the holy ſcripture, and like an Epicure and Atheiſt mocked God: but hee died of the gout after he had ben long plagued with it together with other diſeaſes, leauing none other good name behind him ſaue the report of a moſt wicked and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable man.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Francis Rabelais</hi> hauing ſuckt vp alſo this poiſon, vſed like a prophane villaine to make all religion a matter to laugh and mocke at: but God depriued him of his ſences, that as hee had led a brutiſh life ſo he might die a brutiſh death: for he died mocking all thoſe that talked of God, or made any mention of mercy in his eares.</p>
               <p>How miſerable was the end of <hi>Periers,</hi> the author of that deteſtable booke intituled <hi>Symbalum mundi,</hi> wherin he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mocked at God and his religion: euen hee fell finally into
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1241:77"/> deſpaire, and notwithſtanding all that guarded him killed himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iodelle</hi> alſo, a Frenel tragicall Poet, being an Epicure and an Atheiſt, made a very tragicall and moſt pittifull end: for he died in great miſerie and diſtreſſe euen pined to death after he had rioted out al his ſubſtance and conſumed his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie. <hi>Lignereles</hi> the courtier to make himſelfe ſeeme a man of ſeruice made open profeſsion of Atheiſme, but his end and deſtruction came from thence, whence hee looked for credit and aduancement.</p>
               <p>To bring the matter to an end, I will here ſet downe a notable and ſtrange thing, that chanced in the reigne of <hi>Lewis</hi> the ninth (as <hi>Enguerran de Monstrelet</hi> in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond volume of Hyſtories recordeth it:) vpon the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of Iune in the yeare of our Lord God 1464 there happened a ſtrange thing in the pallace at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris: ſo it was that there was a matter in law to bee tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed betwixt the Biſhop of Angiers and a rich Cittizen, whome the Biſhop charged to haue ſpoken before ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie witneſſes, that hee beleeued not that there was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there God or Deuill, Heauen or hell. Now whileſt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Lawier laid to his charge theſe things, the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to tremble verie much, wherein they were, and a ſtone fell downe from the roofe amongſt them all without hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any: yet euery man was ſore afraid, and departed out of the houſe vntill the morrow: when the matter was begun againe to bee pleaded, which was no ſooner in hand, but the chamber begun afreſh to ſhake, and one of the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers came forth of his mortiſe hole, falling downwards two foot and there ſtaied: ſo that all that were within the hall looking to haue beene ſlaine outright, ran out ſo violently that ſome left behind them their caps, others their hoodes, others their ſlippers: ſummarily, glad was hee that could get out firſt; neither durſt they plead any more cauſes in that place vntill it was mended. Thus much reporteth <hi>Enguerran</hi> without mention of any deciſion of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1241:77"/> that matter: now for as much as nothing happeneth by chance, it is moſt likely that God by that accident would giue vs to vnderſtand both how monſtrous and deteſtable all ſuch ſpeeches are, as alſo how men ought to feare &amp; abhorre them, ſeeing that the dumbe &amp; ſenſleſſe creatures &amp; wood, beames, planckes and ſtones, and the earth at ſelfe, (by nature ſtedfaſt and fixed) are ſo farre from enduring them, that they are moued withall.</p>
               <p>There was a certaine blaſphemous wretch that on a time being with his companions in a common Inne carouſing and making merrie;<note place="margin">Diſcipulus de tempore Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. <hi>132.</hi>
                  </note> asked them if they thought a man was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with a ſoule or no: wherevnto when ſome replied, that the ſoules of men were immortall, and that ſome of them after releaſe from the body liued in heauen, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in hell; for ſo the writings of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles inſtructed them: hee anſwered and ſwore that hee thought it nothing ſo, but rather that there was no ſoule in man to ſuruiue the bodie, but that Heauen and hell were meere fables, and inuentions of Prieſts to get gaine by; and for himſelfe hee was ready to ſell his ſoule to any that would buy it: then one of his companions tooke vp a cup of wine and ſaid, ſell mee thy ſoule for this cup of wine: which hee receiuing bad him take his ſoule, and dranke vp the wine. Now Sathan himſelfe was there in a mans ſhape, (as commonly hee is neuer farre from ſuch meetings) and bought it againe of the other at the ſame price, and by and by bad him giue him his ſoule: the whole companie affirming it was meet hee ſhould haue it, ſince hee had bought it, not perceiuing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill: but preſentlie hee laying hold on this ſoule ſeller, carried him into the aire before them all, toward his owne habitation, to the great aſtoniſhment and amazement of the beholders: and from that day to this hee was neuer heard of, but tried to his paine that men had ſoules: and that hell was no fable according to his godleſſe and profane opinion.</p>

                  <hi>Pherecides</hi> by birth a Syrian, a tragicall Poet and a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher by profeſsion,<note place="margin">Aelianus de var. hiſt. lib. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> boaſted impudently amongſt his ſchollers of his proſperity learning, and wiſdome, ſaying: that although hee offered no ſacrifices vnto the gods, yet hee lead a more quiet and proſperous life then thoſe that were addicted to religion, and therefore hee paſſed not for any ſuch vanitie. But ere long his impietie was iuſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged, for the Lord ſtrooke him with ſuch a ſtrange di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, that out of his bodie iſſued ſuch a ſlimie and filthie ſweat, and engendered ſuch a number of lice and wormes, that his bowels being conſumed by them hee died moſt miſerably.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Theat. hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note>At Hamburge not long ſince there liued an impious wretch that deſpiſed the preaching of the Goſpell and the miniſters thereof, accounting it as a vaine thing, not worthie the beleeuing of any man: neither did he thus himſelfe only but alſo ſeduced many others, bringing them to all Atheiſme and vngodlineſſe. Wherfore the Lord iuſtly recompenced him for his impiety: for he that before had no ſence nor fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God in his conſcience, being touched with the finger of the almightie, grew to the contrary, euen to too much feeling and knowledge of God, that hee fell into extreame deſpaire, affirming now his ſins to be paſt forgiuenes becauſe he had withdrawne others from the truth aſwell as himſelfe, whereas before he thought himſelfe guiltie of no ſinne; and that God was ſo iuſt that he would not forgiue him, wheras before he thought there was no God: (ſo mighty is the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Lord when he pleaſeth to touch the conſcience of man) finally, continuing in this deſperate caſe, hee threw himſelfe from the roofe of a houſe into a well, and not finding water enough to drowne him, hee thruſt his head into the bottome thereof till hee had made an end of his life.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Theat. hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note>In the yeare of our Lord 1502 there liued one <hi>Hermannus Biſwick,</hi> a grand Atheiſt, and a notable inſtrument of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, who affirmed that the world neuer had beginning, as
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1241:78"/> fooliſh <hi>Moſes</hi> dreamed: and that there was neither Angels nor deuils, nor hell, nor future life, but that the ſoules of men periſhed with their bodies: beſides, that Chriſt Ieſus was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, but a ſeducer of the people; and that the faith of Chriſtians, and whatſoeuer elſe is contained in holy writs, was meere vanity. Theſe articles full of impietie and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie, hee conſtantly auouched to the death: And for the ſame cauſe was togither with his bookes burnt in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
               <p>A certaine rich man at Holberſtadium abounding with all manner of earthly commodities,<note place="margin">Theatr. hiſtor.</note> gaue himſelfe ſo much to his pleaſure, that he became beſotted therewith: in ſuch ſort, that hee made no reckening of religion, nor any good thing; but dared to ſay, that if he might lead ſuch a life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually vpon earth, hee would not enuie heauen, nor deſire any exchange. Notwithſtanding ere long (contrary to his expectation) the Lord cut him off by death, and ſo his deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red pleaſure came to an end. But after his death there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſuch diabolicall apparitions in his houſe, that no man da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to inhabit in it, became deſolate, for euery day there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the image of this Epicure ſitting at a boord with a number of his gueſts, drinking, carouſing, and making good cheare; and his table furniſhed with delicates, and attended on by many that miniſtred neceſſaries vnto them, beſide with minſtrels, trumpetters, and ſuch like. In ſumme, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he delighted in his life time, was there to be ſeene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day, the Lord permitting Satan to bleare mens eies with ſuch ſtrange ſhewes, to the end that others might be terrified from ſuch epicuriſme and impietie.</p>
               <p>Not inferiour to any of the former in Atheiſme &amp; impiety, and equall to all in maner of puniſhment was one of our own nation, of freſh and late memory, called <hi>Marlin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Marlow.</note> by profeſsion a ſcholler, brought vp from his youth in the Vniuerſitie of Cambridge, but by practiſe a play-maker, and a Poet of ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilitie, who by giuing too large a ſwinge to his owne wit, and ſuffering his luſt to haue the full raines, fell (not without iuſt
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1241:79"/> deſert) to that outrage and extremitie, that hee denied God and his ſonne Chriſt, and not only in word blaſphemed the trinitie, but alſo (as it is credibly reported) wrote bookes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, affirming our Sauiour to be but a deceiuer, and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to be but a coniurer and ſeducer of the people, and the holy Bible to be but vaine and idle ſtories, and all religion but a deuice of pollicie. But ſee what a hooke the Lord put in the noſthrils of this barking dogge: It ſo fell out, that in London ſtreets as he purpoſed to ſtab one whome hee ought a grudge vnto with his dagger, the other party perceiuing ſo auoided the ſtroke, that withall catching hold of his wreſt, he ſtabbed his owne dagger into his owne head, in ſuch ſort, that notwithſtanding all the meanes of ſurgerie that could be wrought, hee ſhortly after died thereof. The manner of his death being ſo terrible (for hee euen curſed and blaſphemed to his laſt gaſpe, and togither with his breath an oth flew out of his mouth) that it was not only a manifeſt ſigne of Gods iudgement, but alſo an horrible and fearefull terrour to all that beheld him. But herein did the iuſtice of God moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably appeare, in that hee compelled his owne hand which had written thoſe blaſphemies to be the inſtrument to puniſh him, and that in his braine, which had deuiſed the ſame. I would to God (and I pray it from my heart) that all Atheiſts in this realme, and in all the world beſide, would by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance and conſideration of this example, either forſake their horrible impietie, or that they might in like manner come to deſtruction: and ſo that abominable ſinne which ſo flouriſheth amongſt men of greateſt name, might either be quite extinquiſhed and tooted out, or at leaſt ſmothered and kept vnder, that it durſt not ſhew it head any more in the worlds eye.</p>

For be it the image either of Prophet, Apoſtle, or Chriſt Ieſus himſelf, yet it is neceſſary that the law of God ſtand whole and ſound, which ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt make thy ſelfe no grauen image, nor any likenes of things either in heauen aboue, or in earth beneath:</hi>

                  <hi>thou ſhalt not bow downe to them, nor worſhip them, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore he perfourmed the part of a good biſhop, that finding a vaile ſpred in the entrance of a Church dore wherein the image of Chriſt or of ſome other Saint was pictured, rent it in peeces, with theſe words, <hi>That it was againſt the authoritie of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſcripture to haue any image of Chriſt ſet vp in the Church.</hi> After the ſame manner, <hi>Serenus</hi> biſhop of Marſeilla, beate down &amp; baniſhed all images out of his Churches, as occaſions of idolatry: &amp; to ſhun them the more, it was ordained in the

After which time, when images were recalled into Greece &amp; into Conſtantinople (the chiefe city and ſeat of the eaſt Empire) it came to paſſe by a great and dreadfull, yet iuſt iudgement of God, that this famous and renowmed city, in the worlds eie impregnable, after long ſiege, and great and furious aſſaults, was at length taken by the Turkes, who hauing wonne the breach and entred with fury, droue the poore Emperour <hi>Paleologus</hi> (euen till then fighting for the cities defence) to that extremity, that in reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring among the preaſe of his owne ſouldiers, he was thronged and trampled to death; and his ſlaine body being found, was beheaded, and his head contemptuouſly caried about the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vpon a launce. Now after the maſſacre of many thouſand men, to make vp a complete and abſolute cruelty, they drew the Empreſſe with her daughters, and many other Ladies &amp; gentlewomen to a banquet, where after many vile and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wrongs and diſgraces, they killed and tore them in pieces in moſt monſtrous manner. In all which, the execution of Gods moſt iuſt wrath for idolatry did moſt liuely appeare: which ſinne, accompanied with many other execrable and vile vices, muſt needs draw after it a grieuous and terrible puniſhment to ſerue for example to others that were to come: neither was it a thing by chance or haphazzard that the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were made a mocking ſtocke vnto them in that wofull day, when in their bloody triumphes they cauſed a crucifixe to be caried through the ſtreets in contempt, and throwing durt vpon it, cried in their language, <hi>This is the gallant God of Chriſtians.</hi> And thus did God licenſe and permit theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage Turkes to commit eueryday grieuous outrages, and to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:1241:82"/> make great waſtes and deſolations in all Chriſtendome, till that they grew ſo mighty that it is to bee feared leaſt the ſaying of <hi>Lactantius</hi> touching the returne of the Empire into Aſia, be not verified and accompliſhed verie ſhortly, if there bee no amendment practiſed: for we ſee by wofull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that almoſt all the forces which Chriſtian Princes haue muſtered together from all quarters in pretence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt their furie and rage, haue not onely beene bootleſſe and vnprofitable, but alſo that which is worſe, giuen them further occaſion by their bloodie victories and wonderfull ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſo many millions of men, to make them more obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in their deteſtable Mahumetiſme and Turkiſh religion, then they were before: for they make their boaſts thereof, and reare vp trophees of their cruelties, taking no more pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the vanquiſhed, then a butcher doth of ſheepe alot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſlaughter. Whereof we haue a pittifull example in rhe ouerthrow of the French armie which <hi>Iohn</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Philip</hi> duke of Burgundie led againſt the Turke <hi>Pazaite,</hi> and by the trecherie and cowardiſe of the Hungarians, who in the time of battaile turned their backes and fled, was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: in that this wicked and cruell tyger expreſly charged that all the priſoners (in number many) ſhould be murdered one after another; which was readily executed before his eies: ſo that ſauing the chiefe captaine and certain few lords of the companie that were ſpared in reſpect of great ranſoms, there ſcaped not one aliue.</p>

Notwithſtanding al which the holy Pope will ſtill maintaine his idolatrie, albeit the Lord hath made knowne manifeſt tokens of his indignation againſt it.

It was therefore not-without good reaſon that all antiquity euer marked the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the coat of infamie that forſwore themſelues.

                  </note> The Aegyptians had them in deteſtation as prophane perſons, and reputed it ſo capitall a crime that whoſoeuer was conuinced thereof was puniſhed by death. The ancient Romanes reuerenced nothing more then Faith in publicke affaires, for which cauſe they had in their city a temple dedicated to it: wherein for a more ſtreight bond they vſed ſolemnly to promiſe and ſweare to all the conditions of peace, truces and bargaines, which they made, and to curſe thoſe which went about firſt to breake them: for greater ſolemnitie and confirmation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they were accuſtomed at thoſe times to offer ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to the image of faith for more reuerence ſake. Hence it was that <hi>Attilius Regulus</hi> chiefe captaine of the Romane army againſt the Carthaginians was ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended of all men, becauſe when hee was ouercome and taken priſoner and ſent to Rome, he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his othes ſake which hee had ſworne returned againe to the enemie, albeit hee knew what greeuous torments were prouided for him at his returne.

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1241:86"/> moued therevnto: but becauſe they had ſworne to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, if the Romans did not accord to thoſe conditions which were offered, to come againe: they preferred the bond and reuerence of their promiſed faith, though accompanied with perpetuall captiuity, before their priuate commodities, and neereſt linke of affection. But two of thoſe ten (for ſo many were they) falſified their oth, &amp; whatſoeuer miſt they may caſt to darken and diſguiſe their periurie with, yet were they condemned of all men for cowards, and fainthearted traitors: in ſo much that the Cenſors alſo noted them with infamie for the fact, whereat they tooke ſuch griefe and inward ſorrow, that being wearie of their liues, they ſlew themſelues. Now what can they pretend that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe themſelues Chriſtians and Catholickes to excuſe their periuries,<note place="margin">Cic. offic. lib. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> ſeeing that the very Heathen crie out ſo loud and cleare, that an oth and faith is ſo ſacredly to be kept towards our enemies? This is one of the greateſt vertues and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations which the Pſalmiſt attributeth to the faithfull man, and him that feareth God, and whome God auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth for his owne,<note place="margin">Pſal. 15.

Vpon what ground or example of holy Scripture then may that doctrine of the counſell of Conſtance bee founded, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port whereof is, That a man ought not to keepe his faith to Heretiks? I omit to ſpeake how theſe good fathers (by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes) meant thoſe men who fearing God, relied themſelues vpon his word, and reiected the fooliſh and ſuperſtitious inuentions of men. And vnder what colour can the Popes vſurpe this authoritie, to quit and diſcharge
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1241:86"/> ſubiects of their oth wherwith they are bound to their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors? yet this was the impious audacity of Pope <hi>Zacharia,</hi> pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, and pope <hi>Benedict de la Lune,</hi>

               <p>Howbeit if an oath be made either againſt God, or to the dammage and hurt of our neighbour (it being for that cauſe vnlawfull) it behooueth vs to know that we ought to reuoke it, leaſt wee fall into the ſinne of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Herod.</hi>

               <p>About the ſame time there liued in a citie of Sauoy one that was both a monſtruous ſwearer, and alſo otherwiſe very vicious, who put many good men to much fruitleſſe paines, that in regard of their charge emploied themſelues often to admoniſh and reprooue his wicked behauiour, to the end he might amend it: but all in vain, they might as wel caſt ſtones againſt the wind; for he would not ſo much as liſten to their words, much leſſe reforme his manners. Now it fell out that the peſtilence being in the city, hee was infected with it, and therefore withdrew himſelfe a part with his wife &amp; another kinſwoman into a garden which hee had: neither yet in this extremity did the miniſters forſake him, but ceaſed not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to exhort him to repentance, &amp; to lay before his eies his faults and offences, to the end to bring him into the right way.

Therefore one day haſting forward his own miſhap, as he was ſwearing &amp; denying God, and giuing himſelfe to the Deuill, and calling for him with vehemencie, behold euen the Deuill indeed ſnatched him vp ſoddainly, and heaued him into the aire, his wife and kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman looking on, and ſeeing him flie ouer their heads, being thus ſwiftly tranſported, his cap tumbled from his head, and was found at Roſne, but himſelfe no man could euer after ſet eie on.

                  </note> Another profane fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low without any regard of God or his ſeruice, made no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to conuey his corne out of the field on the Lords day in ſermon time; but hee was well rewarded for his godleſſe couetouſneſſe, for the ſame corne which with ſo much care he gathered togither, was conſumed with fire from heauen, with the barne and all the graine that was in it.</p>
               <p>A certaine noble man vſed euery Lords day to go a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the ſermon while,<note place="margin">Theatr. hiſt.</note> which impietie the Lord puniſhed with this iudgement, he cauſed his wife to bring forth a child with a head like a dog, that ſeeing hee preferred his dogs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſeruice of God, he might haue one of his owne get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to make much of.</p>
               <p>At Kimſtat a town in France,<note place="margin">Iob. Fincel. lib. <hi>3.</hi> de mirac.</note> there liued in the yere of our Lord 1559, a certaine couetous woman, who was ſo eager vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the word and greedy of gaine, that ſhe would neither fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the Church to heare the word of God her ſelfe, nor ſuffer any of her family to do it, but continually abode labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and toiling about drying and pilling flax, and doing other domeſticall buſineſſes: neither would ſhee be reclaimed by her neighbors who admoniſhed and dehorted her from ſuch
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1241:103"/> vntimely workes. One Sabbath day as they were thus buſily occupied, fire ſeemed to iſſue among the flaxe without doing any hurt: the next Sabbath day it tooke fire indeed, but was quickly extinct: for all this ſhee continued obſtinate in her prophaneneſſe euen the third Sabbath, when the flax againe taking fire, could not be quenched till it had burnt her &amp; two of her children to death; for though they were recouered out of the fire aliue, yet the next day they all three died. And that which was moſt to be wondred at, a young infant in the cradle was taken out of the midſt of the flame without any hurt. Thus God vſeth to exerciſe his iudgements vpon the contemners of his commandements.</p>

The iuſt report thereof, becauſe I probably know not, I paſſe ouer here to ſet downe, vntill ſuch time as I ſhall be better inſtructed.</p>
               <p>Famous and memorable alſo is that example which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at London in the yeere 1583 at Paris garden, where, vpon the Sabbath day, were gathered togither (as accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mably they vſed) great multitudes of prophane people to behold the fport of bearbaiting, without reſpect of the Lords day, or any exerciſe of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> required therin: which profane impiety the Lord that he might chaſten in ſome ſort, &amp; ſhew his diſlike therof, he cauſed the ſcaffolds ſuddenly to breake, and the beholders to tumble headlong downe: ſo that to the number of eight perſons men &amp; women, were ſlain therwith, beſides many others which were ſore hurt &amp; bruiſed to the ſhortning of their daies. Surely a friendly warning to ſuch as more delight themſelues with the cruelty of beaſts &amp; vaine ſports, than with the works of mercy &amp; religion, the fruits of a true faith, which ought to be the ſabbath daies exerciſe. And thus much for the examples of the firſt table, wherof if ſome

And firſt concerning the firſt commandement thereof, which is, <hi>Honour thy father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that thy daies may be prolonged in the land which the Lord thy God hath giuen thee. Cham,</hi> one of old <hi>Noahs</hi> ſonnes,<note place="margin">Gen. 9.</note> was guilty of the breach of this commandement; who inſtead of perfourming that reuerence to his father which hee ought, (and that preſently after the deluge, which being yet freſh in memory, might haue taught him to walke in the feare of God) came ſo ſhort of his duty, that when he ſaw his naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hee did not hide it, but mocked and ieſted at it: for which cauſe, hee was curſed both of his father and of God in the perſon of his youngeſt ſonne <hi>Chaanan,</hi> and made a ſeruant to the ſeruants of his brethren;<note place="margin">Num 33.

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:1241:105"/> were rooted vp and ſpued out of their land, becauſe of their ſinnes and abominations.</p>
               <p>Marueilous ſtrange was the malice of <hi>Abſolom</hi> to rebell ſo furiouſly againſt his father <hi>Dauid,</hi> as to wage warre againſt him:<note place="margin">2. Sam. 15.</note> which hee did with all his ſtrongeſt endeauours, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſparing any thing that might further his proceedings: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that he grew to that outrage and madneſſe through the wicked and pernicious counſell of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> that hee ſhamed not villanouſly to commit inceſt with his fathers concubines,<note place="margin">2.

Whereby euery man may plainly ſee, that God wanteth no meanes to puniſh ſinners when it pleaſeth him, but maketh the dumbe and ſenſleſſe creatures inſtruments of his vengeance: for hee that had eſcaped the brunt and daunger of the battell (and yet not hauing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eſcaped the hand of God) was by a bruit beaſt, brought vnder a ſenſleſſe tree which God had appointed to catch hold of him, as an executioner of his iuſt iudgement: which if wee conſider, is as ſtraunge and wonderfull an accident as may poſsible happen; and yet ſuch an one as God himſelfe prouided to puniſh this wicked, proud, and rebellious wretch withall: for ſeeing his outrage and villany was ſo great, as to rebell againſt his father, and ſo good and kind a father towards him as hee was, it was moſt iuſt that hee ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſo vile a puniſhment. Beſide, herein God would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe lay open to the eies of all the world, a fearefull ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of his iudgements againſt wicked and diſobedient chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:1241:105"/> thereby to terrifie the moſt impudent and malicious wtetches that liue, from this horrible ſinne. And for the ſame cauſe it was his pleaſure, that that wicked and falſe <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel</hi> ſhould fall into extreame ignominy and confuſion for forſaking <hi>Dauid,</hi> and ſetting forward with counſell and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence young <hi>Abſolom</hi> againſt his father; for which cauſe with deſpaire he hung himſelfe. Now by this example it is eaſie to perceiue how vnpleaſant this ſinne is in Gods ſight, and how much he would haue euery man to hate and deteſt it, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that nature her ſelfe teacheth and inſtructeth vs ſo farre, as to yeeld duty and obedience vnto thoſe that begat, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and brought vs vp.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all this, yet is the world full of ill adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ill nourtured youth, that are little leſſe diſobedient vnto their parents then <hi>Abſolom</hi> was, as <hi>Adramalech</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſar</hi> that ſlew their father <hi>Sennacherib</hi> as he was worſhipping in the temple of <hi>Niſroth</hi> his god: but whereas they looked for the ſoueraignty, they loſt the benefite of ſubiection, and were baniſhed into Armenia, their brother <hi>Eſarhaddon</hi> reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in their ſtead.</p>

                  </note> gathered by an author of credit &amp; fame ſufficient to this effect. It is not long (ſaith he) ſince a friend of mine a man of a great ſpirit and worthy to bee beleeued, recounted to me a very ſtrange accident which hee ſaid hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to himſelfe, and proued his ſaying by the teſtimony of many witneſſes, which was this; that being vpon a time at Naples at a kinſmans and familiars houſe of his, hee heard by night the voice of a man crying in the ſtreet for aid, which cauſed him to riſe and light a candle and run out to ſee what the matter was: being come out of the dores he perceiued a cruell and ougly ſhaped Deuill ſtriuing with all his force to catch and get into his clouches a yoong man that ſtroue on the other ſide to defend himſelfe, &amp; for feare raiſed that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crie which hee had before heard: the yoong man ſeeing him ran to him forthwith, &amp; catching faſt hold by his clothes, and pitifully crying to God, would in no caſe let goe his hold vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till his cruell enemie forſooke him: and being brought into the houſe all diſmaied and beſide himſelfe, would not let goe his hold vntill hee came to his ſences againe out of that exceeding feare. The cauſe of which aſſault was, hee had led all his time a moſt wicked life, and had beene a contemner of God and a rebell againſt his parents, vſing vile railing and bitter ſpeeches againſt them, in ſuch ſort that in ſtead of bleſsing they had laid a curſe vpon him: and this is the firſt example.</p>
               <p>Concerning the ſecond I will alſo ſet downe the Authors
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:1241:107"/> owne words as followeth: of all the ſtrange things (ſayth he) that euer I heard report of, that which happened not long ſince at Rome is moſt worthy to be remembred, of a certain yoong man of Gabia borne of a baſe and poore familie, but endued with a a terrible and furious nature, and addicted to a looſe &amp; diſordinate life. This gallant picking a quarrell with his owne father in his anger reuiled him with moſt groſſe and reprochfull tearmes: In which mad fits, as one whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giuen ouer to the Deuill, hee purpoſely departed to Rome to practiſe ſome naughtie deuiſe againſt his father: but his ghoſtly father the Deuill met with him in the way vnder the ſhape of a cruell and ougly fellow with a thicke buſhy beard and head hanging diſorderly, and clothes al rent and tottered, who (as they walked together) enquired of him why hee was ſo ſad. He anſwered that there had paſſed ſome bitter ſpeeches betwixt his father and him, and now hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed to worke him ſome miſchiefe. The deuill by &amp; by like a crafty knaue ſoothed him vp and ſaid; that he alſo vpon the like occaſion went about the ſame practiſe, and deſired that they might purſue both their voiage &amp; enterpriſe together: it was ſoone agreed vpon betwixt them, being like to like as the Prouerbe goeth. Therefore being arriued at Rome, and lodged at the ſame Inne, one bed did ſerue them both, where whileſt the yoong man ſecurely &amp; ſoundly ſlept, the old ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious knaue watching his oportunity caught him by the throat to ſtrangle him: whereat the poor wretch awoke, and cried for help to God, ſo that the wicked ſpirit was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to forſake him without performing his purpoſe, and to flie out at the chamber with ſuch force &amp; viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that the houſe roofe crackt &amp; the tiles clattered downe abundantly. The hoſt of the houſe being awaked with the noiſe, cried out to know what the matter was, &amp; running into the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber where this noiſe was with a candle in his hand, found the poor yoong man all alone betwixt dead and aliue, of whom (recouered) he learnt out the whole truth as hath beene told: but he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this terrible accident repented him of his wicked life, and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:1241:107"/> was touched with the ſence of his greeuous ſinne ſo nearely, that euer after hee led a more circumſpect and honeſt life. Thus much we find written in that author.</p>

The ſame alſo in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <hi>Philip</hi> of Macedony and <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> were wont to ſay, That they loued a traitour at the firſt, but when he had fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed his treaſon, they hated him more then any other: ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, that traitours deſerued no retribution of thankes, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their office was accepted for a time, yet they themſelues could neuer be counted leſſe than naughty and diſloiall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: for no honeſt man euer betraied his countrey or his friend: and what greater puniſhment can there be than this?
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:1241:113"/> But for manifeſt proofe hereof, let this one example ſerue in ſtead of many, namely of <hi>Theodoricke</hi> king of Francia, and <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minfride</hi> king of Thuringia,<note place="margin">Albert. Crantz.</note> who being profeſt foes, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing fought many cruell battailes, at length the latter was conquered of the former, by the luckie aſsiſtance of the Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This <hi>Irminfride</hi> thus ſubdued, ſued for pardon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe at the conquerours hand, but he was ſo farre from pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eſtate, that hee corrupted one <hi>Iringus</hi> a noble man, and <hi>Irminfrides</hi> ſubiect, to murder his maſter, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed kneeling before <hi>Theodoricke,</hi> running him through with his ſword at his backe: which traiterous deed, aſſoone as it was finiſhed, <hi>Theodoricke</hi> though the ſetter of it, yet hee could not abide the actour, but bad him be packing, for who could put truſt in him that had betraied his owne maſter. At which words <hi>Iringus</hi> (mad with anger and rage) ran at <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doricke</hi> alſo with purpoſe to haue ſlaine him too; but his hand miſsing the marke, returned his ſword into his owne bowels, ſo that he fell downe dead vpon his maſters carkaſſe. What more notable and wonderfull iudgement could happen? ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is an example worthy to be written in golden letters, &amp; to be read and remembred of euery one, to teach men allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and obedience to their princes and ſuperiors, leaſt more ſudden deſtruction than this fall vpon them.</p>

Beſides, many others that went abour the ſame practiſe, were brought to notable deſtructions: as that counterfait foole whome the Italians ſet on to murder <hi>Fredericke</hi> in his chamber, which had beene perfourmed, had he not leaped out of a window into a riuer, and ſo ſaued his life: for the foole being taken, was throwne headlong out of the ſame window, and broke his necke.

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:1241:114"/> found to exceed his by three parts, and therefore counſelled him not to trie the hazard of the battell, but to ſaue his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers liues by flight, which if they tarried, they were ſure to looſe. Wherewithall the Duke miſtruſting no fraud ſore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, tooke the next occaſion of flight, &amp; returned home with diſhonour. Now when theſe three traitours came to the Emperour for their compacted rewards, he cauſed them to be paid in counterfait mony, not equiualing the ſumme of their bargaine by the twentieth part, which though at firſt they diſcerned not, yet afterwards finding how they were couſened, they returned to require their due, and complaine of their wrong. But the Emperor looking ſternly vpon them, anſwered, That counterfait mony was good enough for their counterfait ſeruice, and that if they tarried long, they ſhould haue a due reward of their treaſon.</p>

As for the Earles, one of them (to wit) of Northumberland, was after taken in Scotland and beheaded at Yorke.

               <p>A while after this what befell to <hi>Iohn Throgmorton, Thomas Brooke, George Redman,</hi> and diuerſe other Gentlemen at Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, who pretended a rebellion vnder the colour of ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſtrangers, were they not diſcouered by one of their owne conſpiracy <hi>Thomas Ket,</hi> and executed at Norwich for their paines?

What ſhall I ſay of the Earle of Arundell, and a ſecond Earle of Northumberland? Did not the iuſtice of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in both their endes, when being attainted for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the one ſlew himſelfe in priſon, and the other died by courſe of nature in priſon alſo?

Euen ſo that notorious villaine doctor <hi>Lopus</hi> (the Queens Phiſitian) who a long time had not onely beene an intelligencer to the Pope and King of Spaine, of our Engliſh counſailes, but alſo had poyſoned many Noblemen, and went about alſo to

In ſumme the Lord hath preſerued her maieſtie not onely from theſe but many other ſecret and priuie foes, and that moſt mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly and contrarie to all reaſon, and hath ſpread his winges ouer her to defend her from all her enemies: the conſideration whereof as it ought to ſtirre vp in euerie one a thankfull heart to acknowledge his mercies, and a fearefull care not to diſpleaſe him that is ſo gratious vnto vs: ſo it ought alſo to incite euerie one of vs to pray inceſſantly for her further preſeruation, as being the ſoule of our ſoules, and life of our liues: for ſurely if the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue vs of her life, our ſinnes are the cauſe, and our ſmart will be the effect thereof.</p>
               <p>Moreouer there is yet another kind of treaſon, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rancke of traitors as pernicious as any of the former, and as odious before God and man. Such are they which either vpon priuate quarrels, or receiued iniuries, or hope of gaine, or any other ſilly reſpect, forſake their countries, &amp; take part with the enemies to fight againſt it: or they that in time of neceſsity refuſe to fight or dare not fight in defence of it: the former ſort are called fugitiues, and the latter cowards. As touching the firſt they haue beene alwaies in deteſtation in well gouerned pollicies, and alſo euermore ſeuerely puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. The Aeginates puniſhed them with the loſſe of their right hand thumbes, to the end they might no more handle a ſpeare or a ſword but an oare. The Mitylenians with loſſe of their liues. The inhabitants of Samos marked them in the face with the picture of an oule: and the Romanes puniſhed them after diuerſe faſhions: <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> cauſed all thoſe that had fled from the Romane ſuccours to the enemy to looſe their hands. <hi>Africanus</hi> the former, though gentle &amp; mild by nature, yet in this reſpect he borrowed from forraine cruelty, for hauing conquered Carthage &amp; got into his power all thoſe Romane rebels that tooke part againſt his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, hee hung the Romanes as traitors to their countrie;<note place="margin">Valerius maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</note> and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:1241:117"/> mitigated the puniſhment of the Latines, as but perfidious confederates. <hi>Africanus</hi> the latter when hee had ſubdued the Punicke Nation hee threw all fugitiues amongſt wild beaſts to be deuoured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucius Paulus</hi> after the conqueſt of the king of Perſia, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted theſe fellows to the mercie of <hi>Eliphantes.</hi> Generally there is no Nation vnder the ſunne which holdeth them not in execration; and therfore our Engliſh fugitiues, who vnder cloke of religion not onely abandon their countrie, their kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and their Prince, but alſo conſpire the vndoing &amp; ſwear the deſtruction of them: are they not worthie to be handled like traitors and to haue their quarters ſpectacles of perfidie?

               <p>As touching cowards (I meane ſuch as preferring their liues or liberty or any other by-reſpects before their countries welfare, &amp; either dare not or wil not ſtand ſtoutly in defence of it in time of war and danger) they deſerue no leſſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then the former, ſeeing that as they are open oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſo theſe are cloſe vnderminers of the good thereof. And therefore the Romans did ſharply chaſten them in their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, as may appear by diuerſe examples of the ſame: as firſt they were noted with this ignominy, neuer to eat their meat but ſtanding; &amp; hereunto they were ſworne: Nay they were in ſuch hatefull account amongſt them,<note place="margin">Alex. ab Alex.</note> that when <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball</hi> offered the Senat 8000 captiues to be redeemed, they refuſed his offer, ſaying that they were not worthy to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, that had rather bee taken baſely then die honeſtly &amp; valiantly: the ſame Senat dealt more fauourably with the captiues which king <hi>Pirrhus</hi> tooke, for they redeemed them but with this diſgrace, degrading them from their honors and places, vntill by a double ſpoile they had won their reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againe. <hi>L.

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:1241:117"/> without ſeames, hee forbad him ſociety with any ſaue ſuch as were noted with the ſame fault, and from a Generall ouer horſemen, he debaſed him to a common ſouldior.

                  </note> whileſt king <hi>Iohn</hi> was held priſoner in England, there aroſe a great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motion of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people in France againſt the nobilitie and gentilitie of the realme, that oppreſſed them: this tumult began but with an hundred men that were gathered togither in the countrey of Beauvoiſin, but that ſmall handfull grewe right quickly to an armefull, euen to nine thouſand, that ranged and robbed throughout al Brie, along by the riuer Marne to Laonoiſe, and all about Soiſſons, armed with great bats ſhod with iron: an headleſſe crue without gouernour, fully purpoſing to bring to ruine the whole nobility. In this diſorder they wrought much miſchief, broke vp many houſes and caſtles, murdered many Lords; ſo that diuerſe Ladies and knights, as the Dutcheſſes of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy, Orleance, were faine to flee for ſafegard to Meaux: whither when theſe rebels would needes purſue them, they were there ouerthrowen, killed and hanged by troupes.</p>
               <p>In the yere of our Lord 1525,<note place="margin">Sleid. lib. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> there were certaine husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Souabey that began to ſtand in reſiſtance againſt the Earle of Lupsfen, by reaſon of certaine burdens which they complained themſelues to be ouerlaid with by them: their neighbors ſeeing this, enterpriſed the like againſt their lords: And ſo vpon this ſmall beginning (by a certaine contagion) there grew vp a moſt dangerous and fearfull commotion, that ſpread it ſelfe almoſt ouer all Almaine: the ſedition thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing in all quarters, and the ſwaines being now full fortie thouſand ſtrong, making their owne liberty and the Goſpels a cloake to couer their treaſon and rebellion, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of their vndertaking armes (to the wonderfull griefe
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:1241:122"/> of all that feared God) did not only fight with the Romane Catholikes, but with all other without reſpect, as well in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uabe as in Franconia: they deſtroied the greater part of the nobility, ſacked and burnt many caſtles and fortreſſes, to the number of two hundred, and put to death the Earle of Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtin, making him paſſe through their pikes. But at length their ſtrength was broken, they diſcomfited and torne in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with a moſt horrible maſſacre of more than eighteene thouſand of them. During this ſedition, there were ſlaine on each ſide fifty thouſand men. The captaine of the Souabian ſwaines called <hi>Geiſmer</hi> hauing betaken himſelfe to flight, got ouer the mountaines to Padua, where by treaſon hee was made away.</p>
               <p>In the yeere of our Lord 1517, in the Marqueſdome of the Vandales, the like inſurrection and rebellion was of the comminaltie; eſpecially the baſer ſort againſt the nobilitie, ſpirituall and temporall, by whom they were oppreſſed with intollerable exactions: their army was numbred to ſtand of ninety thouſand men all clownes and husbandmen, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired togither to redreſſe and refourme their owne grieuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, without any reſpect of ciuill magiſtrate, or feare of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God. This raſcality of ſwaines raged and tyranized euery where, burning and beating downe the caſtles and houſes of noble men, and making their ruines euen with the ground: Nay they handled the noble men themſelues as many as they could attaine vnto, not contumeliouſly only, but rigorouſly and cruelly; for they tormented them to death, and carried their heads vpon ſpeares in token of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. Thus they ſwaied a while vncontrolled, for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Maximilian</hi> winked at their riots, as beeing acquainted with what iniuries they had bene ouercharged: but when he perceiued that the rude multitude did not limit their fury within reaſon, but let it runne too lauiſh to the damnifying as well the innocent as the guilty, hee made out a certaine ſmall troupe of mercenary ſouldiers togither with a band of horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to ſuppreſſe them, who comming to a city were preſently
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1241:122"/> ſo inuironed with ſuch a multitude of theſe ſwaines that like locuſts ouerſpread the earth, that they thought it impoſsible to eſcape with their liues; wherefore feare and extremitie made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ruſh out to battel with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But ſee how the Lord proſpereth a good cauſe, for all their weake number in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of their enemies, yet ſuch a feare poſſeſſed their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hearts, that they fled like troupes of ſheepe, and were ſlaine liee dogs before them: inſomuch that they that eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the ſword, were either hanged by flockes on trees, or ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted on ſpits by fires, or otherwiſe tormented to death. And this end befell that wicked rebellious rout, which wrought ſuch miſchiefe in that countrey with their monſtrous villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that the traces and ſteppes thereof remaine at this day to be ſeene.</p>
               <p>In the yeere of our Lord 1381,<note place="margin">Stow Chron.</note> 
                  <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond being king, the commons of England (and eſpecially of Kent and Eſſex) by meanes of a taxe that was ſet vpon them, ſuddenly rebelled and aſſembled togither on Blackheath, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 60000 or more: which rebellious rout, had none but baſe and ignoble fellowes for their captaines, as <hi>Wat Tilour, Iacke Straw, Tom Miller,</hi> but yet they cauſed much trouble and diſquietneſſe in the realme, and chiefly about the citie of London, where they committed much villanie in deſtroying many goodly places; as the Sauoy, and others: and being in Smithfield vſed themſelues very proudly and vnreuerently towards the king: but by the manhood and wiſdome of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Walworth</hi> Maior of London, (who arreſted their chiefe captaine in the midſt of them) that rude company was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited, and the ringleaders of them worthily puniſhed.</p>
               <p>In like manner in the raigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeuenth,<note place="margin">Stow Chron.</note> a great commotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was ſtirred vp in England by the commons of the North, by reaſon of a certaine taxe which was leuied of the tenth penny of all mens lands &amp; good within the land; in the which, the Earle of Northumberland was ſlaine: But their raſh attempt was ſoone broken, and <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine with diuers others hanged at Yorke for the ſame. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:1241:123"/> their example ſcared not the Corniſh men fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rebelling vpon the like occaſion of a taxe, vnder the conduct of the lord Audley; vntill by wofull experience they felt the ſame ſcourge: for the king met them vpon blacke heath, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfiting their troupes, tooke their captains and ringleaders, and put them to moſt worthy and ſharpe death.</p>
               <p>Thus we may ſee the vnhappie iſſue of all ſuch ſeditious reuoltings, and thereby gather how vnpleaſant they are in the ſight of God.

                  <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill:</hi> the Lord denounceth this iudgement vpon it, that he which ſtriketh a man that hee dieth, ſhall die the death. And this is correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to that edict which he gaue to <hi>Noah</hi> preſently after the vniuerſall flood, to ſuppreſſe that generall crueltie which had taken root from the beginning in <hi>Cain</hi> and his poſterity, being carefull for mans life,<note place="margin">Gen. 9.</note> ſaying, <hi>That hee will require the blood of man, at the hands of either man or beaſt that killeth him:</hi> adding moreouer, <hi>That whoſoeuer ſheddeth mans blood, by man alſo his blood ſhall be ſhed, ſeeing that God created him after his owne image:</hi> which he would not haue to be baſely accounted of, but deare and pretious vnto vs.<note place="margin">Exod. 21.</note> If then the bruit and vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creatures are not exempted from the ſentence of death pronounced in the law, if they chance to kill a man: How much more puniſhable then is man, endued with will &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when maliciouſly and aduiſedly he taketh away the life
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:1241:123"/> of his neighbour? But the hainouſnes &amp; greatnes of this ſinne is moſt liuely expreſſed by that ordinance of God ſet downe in the 21 of Deuteronomie, where it is enioyned, That if a man be found ſlaine in the field,<note place="margin">Deut. 21.</note> and it be not knowen who it was that ſlue him, then the Elders and Iudges of the next towne aſſembling togither, ſhould offer vp an expiatorie ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice by the hands of the prieſts, to demand pardon for that cruell murder, that the guilt of innocent blood might not be imputed vnto them. And if by ouerſight or negligence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any malice, hatred, or pretence, one killed another, yet was he not exempted from all puniſhment,<note place="margin">Num. 35.</note> but ſuffered to fly to the citie of refuge to be kept, and as it were, incloſed vntill his innocencie were made manifeſt, or at the leaſt vntill the death of the high prieſt. From this (it may ſeeme) aroſe the cuſtome of Painyms in the like caſe, which was, that if a man vnwillingly had committed murder, hee did preſently auoid the countrey, and go vnto ſome man of power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a ſtraunge nation, and preſent himſelfe at his gate, ſitting with his face couered humbly, intreating pardon and reconciliation for his murder: and for one whole yeere hee might not returne into his owne counrrey. On this manner was the ſonne of a certaine king of Phrygia entertained in king <hi>Craeſus</hi> court,<note place="margin">Herod. lib. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> who vnaduiſedly had ſlaine his owne bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Whereby it is manifeſt, how odious and execrable in all ages, and all places, and all people, this homicide and murder hath beene: inſomuch that men did ſhun their very meeting and companie, and abandon them out of their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and publicke aſſemblies, as people excommunicate and prophane. And yet for all this, mankind (for the moſt part) like ſauagde beaſts hath by the inſtigation of that wicked ſpirit, (who was a murderer from the beginning) bene too too addicted to this kind of cruelty, not being afraid to offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to nature, and ſhed innocent blood. Such was the fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke &amp; peruerſe crueltie of the ſecond man <hi>Cain,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> when with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any occaſion, but only through enuy he ſlew his only bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abel,</hi> and that traiterouſly: which deed, albeit it was
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:1241:124"/> done in ſecret and without the view of men, yet it could not ſhun the piercing eie of God, who reprooued him for it, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That the blood of Abell cried for vengeance from the earth.</hi> And although this curſed and wicked murderer receiued not immediatly a condigne puniſhment anſwerable to his crime, (God to the end to ſpare mans blood, vſing vndeſerued fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour towards him) yet eſcaped he not ſcotfree, for he was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued with a continuall torment and ſting of conſcience, togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſuch an inceſſant feare, that he became a vagabond and a runnagate vpon the earth: and ſeeing himſelfe brought into ſo miſerable an eſtate, he fell to complaining that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment was greater then he was able to beare. Thus God permitted this wretch to draw out his life in ſuch anguiſh, that for a greater puniſhment he might pine away the reſt of his daies without comfort. A man may find in this world ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch brother-murdering <hi>Cains,</hi> who for no occaſion ſticke not to cut their throats, whom (for the bond of common na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wherein all men are linked togither as branches of one root) they ought to acknowledge for their brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; friends: vpon whome, the heauie hand of God hath not beene more ſlacke to puniſh either by one means or other, then it was vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their eldeſt brother <hi>Cain.</hi> But ſeeing the number of them is ſo great, and it is not ſo conuenienr to heap vp here ſo huge a multitude togither, it ſhall ſuffice only to recount the moſt famous and notableſt of them, as of thoſe that haue ben men of note and reputation in the world, or that through an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious deſire of raigning, haue by armes ſought to atchieue their purpoſes: for theſe for the moſt part are the greateſt murderers and butchers of all, that through their wicked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, worldly pomp, or deſire of reuenge, haue no remorſe of making the blood of men runne like riuers vpon the earth, making no more account of the life of a man, then of a fly or a worme.</p>

After which maſſacre, hee raigned in iollitie three yeeres, and at the end thereof was cut ſhort by God, togither with the Sichemites his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uokers and maintainers, who were alſo guiltie of all the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood which hee had ſhed: for God ſent the ſpirit of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion betwixt them, ſo that the Sichemites began to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe him, and rebell againſt him; but they had the worſt end of the ſtaffe, and were ouercome by him: who purſuing the victory, tooke their citie by force, and put them all to the edge of the ſword. And after hee had thus deſtroied their citie, put fire alſo to the caſtle, wherein he conſumed neere about a thouſand perſons of men and women, that were reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thither to ſaue their liues. And thus God brought vpon them the miſchiefe which they had conſented and put their hands vnto: For as they had lent him aid and furtherance to the ſhedding of his breethrens blood, ſo was their own blood with their wiues and childrens ſhed by him: yet this tyrant not content therewith, made warre alſo with the inhabitants of Tebez, and tooke their city, and would haue forced the tower alſo wherein the citizens had incloſed themſelues, but as he approched to the wall, a woman threw downe a peece of a milſtone vpon his head, wherewith finding himſelfe hurt to death, he commanded one of his ſouldiers to kill him out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. And thus this wicked murderer that had ſhedde the blood of many men, yea of his owne brethren, had his braines knockt out by a woman, and died a moſt deſperate death.</p>

Afterwards there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſedition raiſed in the city Argos betweene two of the chiefeſt citizens, one of the which ſent vnto him for aid, hee (what iſſue ſoeuer was like to enſue, whether victorie or van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhment) could not abide in peace from diſquieting others and himſelfe, but muſt needes goe to take part in that ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but to his coſt euen to his deſtruction. For firſt in his way hee found an euill-fauoured welcome by an Ambuſh placed of purpoſe to interrupt his iourney, amongſt whom he loſt his ſonne: which miſhap nothing diſmaied him, nor abated any whit of his purpoſe or courage from purſuing this iourney to Argos, though the citizens themſelues intreated him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and though he had no buſineſſe there ſaue only to looke ouer the towne: being arriued by night, &amp; finding a gate left open for him to enter by, by the means of him that had ſent for him to his aid, hee put his ſouldiors in, and poſſeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of the towne incontinently. But the city being aided by <hi>Antigonus</hi> and the king of Sparta, charged and preſſed him ſo ſore, that he ſought meanes to retire out of the ſame, but could not. At which time being about ro ſtrike a yoong man of the citie that had done him ſome hurt, his mother being aloft vpon the roofe of an houſe, perceiuing his intent threw downe a tile with both her handes vpon his head, and hat him ſuch a knocke vpon the necke through default of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that it ſo bruſed his ioints that hee fell into a ſuddaine

As they were readie to ioine battaile, <hi>Sigiſmunds</hi> ſouldiours forſooke him, ſo that hee was taken and preſently put to death, and his ſonnes which hee had by his ſecond wife were taken alſo and carried captiue to Orleance, &amp; there drowned in a well. Thus was the execrable murder of <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> &amp; his wife puniſhed in their owne children. As for <hi>Cleodomire</hi> though hee went conquerour from this battaile, yet was hee encountred with another deſaſtrous miſfortune: for as hee marched forward with his forces to fight with <hi>Sigiſmunds</hi> brother, he was by him ouercome and ſlain: and for a further diſgrace, his diſmembred head faſtened on the top of a pike carried about to the enterview of all men.

In this ſtrange &amp; monſtrous act <hi>Clotaire</hi> ſhewed himſelfe more then barbarous, when hee would not take pitty vpon the youngeſt of the two, being but ſeuen yeare old, who hearing his brother (of the age of tenne yeares) crying pittifully at his ſlaughter, threw himſelfe at his vncle <hi>Childeberts</hi> feet with teares deſiring him to ſaue his life, wherewith <hi>Childebert</hi> being greatly affected, entreated his brother with weeping eies to haue pitty vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and ſpare the life of this poore infant; but al his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and entreaties could not hinder the ſauadge beaſt from performing this cruell murder vpon this poor child, as he had done vpon the other.</p>

Vnder his regencie the forces of the Empire grew wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly into decay: France, Spaine, Almaigne and Lumbardy reuolted from the Empire: and at laſt himſelfe being purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his ſonne in law <hi>Priſcus</hi> with the Senators, vvas ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and hauing his handes and feet cut off, was togither

               <p>Among all the ſtrange examples of Gods iudgements that euer were declared in this world, that one that befell a king of Poleland called <hi>Popiell</hi> for his murders, is for the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof moſt worthy to bee had in memory: hee raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the year of our Lord 1346, this man among other of his particular kinds of curſings and ſwearing whereof he was no niggard, vſed ordinarily this oth: <hi>If it bee not true would rats might deuour me,</hi>

                  </note> prophecying thereby his owne deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for hee was deuoured euen by the ſame means which hee ſo often wiſhed for, as the ſequele of his hiſtorie will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. The father of this <hi>Popiell</hi> feeling himſelfe neare death reſigned the gouernment of his kingdome to two of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, men exceedingly reuerenced of all men for the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor and vertue which appeared in them. He being deceaſed and <hi>Popiell</hi> being growne vp to ripe and lawfull yeares, when hee ſaw himſelfe in full libertie without all bridle of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to doe what he liſted, he began to giue the full ſwindge to his lawleſſe and vnruly deſires, in ſuch ſort that within few daies he became ſo ſhameleſſe, that there was no kind of vice which appeared not in his behauior, euen to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the death of his owne vncles, for all their faithfull dealing towards him, which hee by poyſon brought to paſſe. Which being done he cauſed himſelf forthwith to be crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with garlands of flowers and to bee perfumed with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ointments: and to the end the better to ſolemnize his entrie to the crowne, commanded a ſumptuous and pompous banket to be prepared, wherevnto all the princes and lords of his kingdome were inuited. Now as they were about to giue the onſet vpon the delicate cheare, behold an army of rats ſallying out of the dead and putrified bodies of his vncles ſet vpon him, his wife, and children, amid their dainties to gnaw them with their ſharp teeth, inſomuch that his guard with all their weapons &amp; ſtrength were not able to chaſe them away, but being weary with reſiſting their daily &amp; mightie aſſaults,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:1241:132"/> gaue ouer the battaile: wherfore counſell was giuen to make great coale fires round about them, that the rats by that meanes might bee kept off, not knowing that no pollicy or power of man was able to withſtand the vnchangeable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God: for, for all their huge forces they ceaſed not to run through the midſt of them and to aſſault with their teeth this cruell murderer. Then they gaue him counſaile to put himſelfe, his wife, &amp; children into a boat and thruſt it into the middeſt of a lake, thinking that by reaſon of the waters the rats would not approch vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: But alaſſe in vain, for they ſwum through the waters amaine &amp; gnawing the boat, made ſuch chinckes into the ſides thereof that the water began to run in, which being perceiued of the boatmen, amazed them ſore, and made them make poſt haſt vnto the ſhore, where he was no ſooner arriued, but a freſh muſter of rats vniting their forces with the former, encountred him ſo ſore, that they did him more ſcath then all the reſt. Wherevpon all his guard and others that were there preſent for his defence, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing it to be a iudgement of Gods vengeance vpon him, abandoned and forſooke him at once: who ſeeing himſelfe deſtitute of ſuccour and forſaken on all ſides, flew into a high tower in Chouſuitze, whether alſo they purſued him, and cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming euen vp to the higheſt roome where he was, firſt eat vp his wife and children (ſhee being guilty of his vncles death) and laſtly gnew and deuoured him to the very bones.</p>
               <p>After the ſame ſort was an Archbiſhop of Mentz, called <hi>Hatto,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Munſteer Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mographie.</note> puniſhed in the year 940 vnder the raigne of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Otho</hi> the great, for the extreame cruelty which he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed towards certaine poore beggers, whom in time of famine he aſſembled together into a great barne, not to releeue their wants as he might &amp; ought, but to rid their liues, as he ought not, but did: for hee ſet on fire the barne wherein they were, and conſumed them all aliue comparing them to rats &amp; miſe that deuoured good corne, but ſerued to no other good vſe.<note place="margin">

In memorial wherof, this tower was euer after called the tower of rats. And this was the tragedy of that bloody archbutcher that compared poor Chriſtian ſoules to brutiſh &amp; baſe creatures, and therfore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came himſelfe a prey vnto them, as <hi>Popiel</hi> king of Poleland did before him. In whoſe ſtrange exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples the beams of Gods iuſtice ſhine forth after an extraordinary &amp; wonderfull maner to the terror &amp; feare of all men: when by the means of ſmall creatures he made roome for his vengea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to make entrance vpon theſe execrable creature murderers, notwithſtanding al mans deuiſes &amp; impediments of nature; for the natiue opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the elements was reſtrained fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hindering the paſſage of them, armed &amp; inſpired with an inuincible &amp; ſupernatural courage to feare neither fire, water, nor weapon, till they had finiſhed his command that ſent them. And thus in old time did frogs, flies, graſhoppers and lice make warre with <hi>Pharoa</hi> at the command of him that hath all the world at his beck.</p>
               <p>After this Archbiſhop in the ſame ranke of murderers we find regiſtred many Popes, of all whome the notorious and markable are theſe two, <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth and <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, who deſerued rather to be called <hi>Nocents</hi> &amp; <hi>Malefaces</hi> than <hi>Innocents</hi> &amp; <hi>Boniface,</hi> for their wicked &amp; peruerſe liues: for as touching the firſt of them, from the time that hee was firſt inſtalled in the Papacy, he alwaies bent his horns againſt the Emperor <hi>Fredericke,</hi> &amp; fought with him with an army not of men, but of excommunications &amp; curſings as their manner is: &amp; ſeeing that all his thundering buls and canons could not preuaile ſo far as hee deſired, hee preſently ſought to bring to
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:1241:133"/> paſſe that by treaſon which by force he could not: for hee ſo enchanted certain of his houſhold ſeruants with foule bribes and faire words,<note place="margin">Hieron.

Moreouer he was chiefe ſower of that war betwixt <hi>Henry,</hi> Lantgraue of Thuring, whom he created king of the Romans, &amp; <hi>Conrade, Fredericks</hi> ſon, wherein hee reaped a crop of diſcomfitures &amp; ouerthrows: after which he was found ſlain in his bed, his body being full of black marks, as if he had ben beaten to death with cudgels.</p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Boniface,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Baleus.</note> after he had by ſubtle &amp; crafty means made his predeceſſor diſmiſſe himſelfe of his Papacy and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thronized himſelfe therein, hee put him to death in priſon: and afterward made war vpon the Gibilines and committed much crueltie: wherefore alſo he died mad as we heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

                  <hi>Lewis</hi> duke of Orleance, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt, by the complot &amp; deuiſe of <hi>Iohn</hi> duke of Burgundy, who (as he was naturally haughty &amp; ambitious) went about to vſurpe the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the realm of France, for that the king by reaſon of weakneſſe of his braine was not able to manage the affairs therof, ſo that great trouble &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuil wars were growne vp by that occaſion in euery corner of the realme. As therfore he affected and gaped after the rule, ſo he thought no means diſhoneſt to attain vnto it, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his firſt enterpriſe was to take out of the way the kings brother who ſtood betwixt him and home. Hauing therfore prouided fit champions for his purpoſe, hee found oportunity one night to cauſe him to come out of his lodging late by counterfait tokens from the king, as if hee had ſent for him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſome matters of importance: and being in the way to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> hoſtle, where the kings lodging was in Paris, the poore prince ſuſpecting nothing was ſodainly ſet vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with eighteen roiſters at once, with ſuch fury &amp; violence, that in very ſhort ſpace they left him dead vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the pauement by the gate Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, his braines lying ſcattered about the ſtreet. After this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable and odious act committed and detected, the cruell
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:1241:134"/> Burgundian was ſo farre from ſhaming, that he vaunted and boaſted at it, as if he had atchieued the moſt valorous and honourable exploit in the world (ſo farre did his impudencie outſtretch the bond of reaſon.) Neuertheleſſe to caſt ſome counterfait colour vpon this rough practiſe, he vſed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and fidelitie of three famous diuines of Paris, who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly in publicke aſſemblies approoued of this murder, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That he had greatly offended, if hee had left it vndone. About this deuiſe hee emploied eſpecially M. <hi>Iohn Petit</hi> a Sorboniſt doctor, whoſe raſhnes and braſen-facednes was ſo great, as in the counſell houſe of the king, ſtoutly to auerre, that that which was done in the death of the duke of Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, was a vertuous and commendable action, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of it to be void of fault, and therefore ought to be void of puniſhment. The preface which this braue oratour vſed was, That he was bounden in duty to the duke of Burgundy, in regard of a goodly penſion which he had receiued at his hands, and for that cauſe he had prepared his poore tongue in token of gratitude to defend his cauſe. Hee might better haue ſaid thus, That ſeeing his tongue was poore and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and he himſelfe a ſenſleſſe creature, therfore he ought not to allow or defend ſo obſtinately ſuch a deteſtable and traiterous murder committed vpon a Duke of Orleance, and the ſame the kings brother, in ſuch vile ſort; and that if hee ſhould do otherwiſe, he ſhould approoue of that which God and man apparantly condemned, yea the very Turkes and greateſt Painyms vnder heauen; &amp; that he ſhould iuſtify the wicked &amp; condemne the innocent, which is an abomination before God; &amp; ſhould put darknes in ſtead of light, and call that which is euill, good (for which the Prophet <hi>Eſai</hi> in his 1 chapter denounceth the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God againſt falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets) &amp; ſhould follow the ſteps of <hi>Balaam,</hi> which let out his tongue to hire for the wages of iniquity: but none of theſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes came once into his mind. But to returne to our hiſtory: The duke of Burgundy hauing the tongues of theſe braue doctors at his commaundement, and the Pariſians who bore
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:1241:135"/> themſelues partially in this quarrel) generally fauourers of his ſide, came to Paris in armes, to iuſtifie himſelfe as he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſtroke ſuch a dreadfull awe of himſelfe into all mens minds, that notwithſtanding all the earneſt purſuit of the Ducheſſe the widow of Orleance for iuſtice, he eſcaped vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed, vntill God (by other meanes) tooke vengeance vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: which happened after a while, after that thoſe his complices of Paris (being become lords and rulers of the city) had committed many horrible and cruell murders, as of the Conſtable and Chancellour, two head officers of the realme, whoſe bodies faſt bound togither they drew naked through the ſtreets from place to place in moſt deſpitefull maner: for the <hi>Daulphin</hi> eſcaping their hands by night, and ſafeguarded in his caſtle, after that hee heard of the ſeaſure of the citie, found meanes to aſſemble certaine forces, and marched to Montereaufautyon with twenty thouſand men, of purpoſe to be reuenged on the Duke for all his braue &amp; riotous demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors: hither vnder colour of parling &amp; deuiſing new means to pacifie theſe old ciuill troubles, he enticed the duke, &amp; being come, at his very firſt arrtuall, as he was bowing his knee in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence to him, he cauſed him to be ſlaine: And on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was the duke of Orleance death quitted, &amp; the euill and cruelty ſhewed towards him, returned vpon the murderers owne necke; for as hee ſlew him treacherouſly &amp; cowardly, ſo was hee alſo treacherouſly and cowardly ſlaine, and iuſtly requited with the ſame meaſure that he before had meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to another:<note place="margin">Treaſon, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</note> notwithſtanding herein the Daulphin was not free from a grieuous crime of diſloialtie &amp; truth breach, in working his death without ſhame of either faith-breach, or periury, and that in his owne preſence, whom he had ſo often with proteſtation of aſſurance and ſafety, requeſted to come vnto him.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F all effuſion of humane blood bee both hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to behold and repugnant to nature, then is the murdering of parents eſpecially deteſtable, when a man is ſo poſſeſſed with the deuill, or tranſported with a helliſh fury, that he lifteth vp his hand againſt his owne naturall father or mother to put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to death: this is ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and inormious an impiety that the greateſt Barbarians euer haue had it in deteſtation: wherefore it is alſo expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded in the law of God, that vvhoſoeuer ſmiteth his father or mother in what ſort ſoeuer, though not to death,<note place="margin">Exod. 21.</note> yet he ſhall die the death.

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:1241:141"/> appointed no puniſhment in his lawes for Parricides; anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that there was no neceſsity, thinking that the wide world could not affoord ſo wicked a wretch. It is ſaid that <hi>Romulus</hi> for the ſame cauſe ordained no puniſhment in his Common-wealth for that crime, but called euery murderer a Parricide, the one being in his opinion a thing execrable, and the other impoſſible. And in truth there was not for 600 years ſpace (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Plutarchs</hi> report) found in Rome any one that had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted this execrable fact.

                  <hi>Martin Luther</hi> was wont to report of his owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence this wonderfull hiſtory of a lockſmith, a young man, riotous and vicious, who to find fuell for his luxury, was ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, that he feared not to ſlay his owne father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a hammer, to the end to gaine their mony and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsions: after which cruell deed, he preſently went to a ſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker and bought him new ſhoes, leauing his old behind him, by the prouidence of God to be his accuſers: for after an houre or two, the ſlaine bodies being found by the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and inquiſition made for the murderer, no manner of ſuſpition being had of him, hee ſeeming to take ſuch griefe thereat. But the Lord that knoweth the ſecrets of the heart, diſcouered his hypocriſie, and made his owne ſhoes which he had left with the ſhoemaker riſe vp to beare witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: for the blood which ran from his fathers wounds beſprinkled them ſo, that thereof grew the ſuſpition, &amp; from thence the examination, &amp; very ſoone the confeſsion, &amp; laſt of all his worthy &amp; lawfull execution. From hence wee may learne for a generall truth, that murder, neuer ſo ſecret, will euer by one means or other be diſcouered; the Lord will not ſuffer it to goe vnpuniſhed, ſo abominable it is in his ſight.</p>
               <p>Another ſonne at Boſil, in the yere of our Lord God 1560, bought a quantitie of poiſon of an Apothecary,<note place="margin">Caſp. Hed. <hi>4.</hi> part. chron.</note> &amp; miniſtred it to none but to his owne father, accounting him worthieſt of ſo great a benefit: which, when it had effected his wiſh vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, the crime being detected, in ſtead of poſſeſsing his goods which he aimed at, hee poſſeſſed a vile and ſhamefull death: for he was drawne through the ſtreets, burnt with hot
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:1241:143"/> irons, and tormented nine houres in a wheele, till his life for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke him. As it is repugnant to nature for children to deale thus cruelly with their parents, ſo it is more againſt nature for parents to murder their children: inſomuch as naturall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is of greater force in the deſcent, then in the aſcent, &amp; the loue that parents beare their children, is greater then that which children redound to their parents, becauſe the child proceedeth from the father, and not the father from the child, as part of his fathers eſſence, and not the father of his: Can a man then hate his owne fleſh, or be a rooter out of that which himſelfe planted? It is rare: yet ſometimes it commeth to paſſe. Howbeit as the offence is in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, ſo it is alwaies puniſhed by ſome notable and high iudgement: as by theſe examples that follow, ſhall appeare.</p>
               <p>The ancient Ammonites had an idoll called <hi>Moloch,</hi> to the which they offered their children in ſacrifice: this idoll (as the Iewes write) was of a great ſtature and hollow within, hauing ſeuen chambers in his hollowneſſe, whereof one was to receiue meate, another turtle doues, the third a ſheepe, the fourth a ram, the fift a calfe, the ſixt an oxe, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth a child: his hands were alwaies extended to receiue gifts, and when a child was offered, they were made fire hot to burne it to death; none muſt offer the child but the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: &amp; to drowne the cries of it, the Chemarims (for ſo were the prieſts of that idoll called) made a noiſe with bels, cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals, and hornes: thus it is written that king <hi>Achab</hi> offered his ſon, yea &amp; many of the children of Iſrael beſide, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Dauid</hi> affirmeth: <hi>They offered</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>their ſonnes and daughters to deuils, &amp; ſhed innocent blod,</hi>

                  <hi>euen the blood of their children, whom they offered vnto the idols of Canaan, and their land was defiled with blood:</hi> this is the horrible crime. Now mark the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t touching the Canaanites; the land ſpued them out for their abominations, <hi>Achab</hi> with his poſterity was accurſed, himſelfe being ſlaine by his enemies, and the crowne taken from his poſterity, not one being left of his off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring to piſſe againſt the wal: according to the ſaying of <hi>Elias:</hi>

Furthermore being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to obtaine a victorie ouer the Parthians, that hee might get himſelfe fame and reputation thereby, hee paſſed not at what rate he bought it: He ſent therefore Embaſſadors with letters and preſents to the king of Parthia, to demand his daughter in marriage, though hee neuer entended any ſuch thing, and being nonſuted at the firſt with a deniall, yet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued he his counterfeit purpoſe with much earneſtneſſe: and with ſolemne oath proteſted his ſingular good affection and loue that he bore vnto her: ſo that in the end the match was condiſcended vnto by all parties, whereof the Parthian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were not a little glad, in hope of ſo durable a peace which by this marriage was like to be eſtabliſhed betwixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                  </note> for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhmen in regard of their owne ſmall number, and the huge multitude of the French to encounter with them, timorouſly offered vp a ſurrender of all that they had either conquered, taken, or ſpoiled ſince their comming from Bordeaux, and ſo to be ſworne not to beare armes againſt him for ſeuen yeeres, ſo that they might quietly depart. But the king that crowed before the conqueſt, affying too much in the multitude of his forces, ſtopt his eares to all conditions, not willing to heare of any thing but war, war, euen thinking to hew them in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, without one eſcaping: but it fell out otherwiſe, for the Engliſhmen intrenching themſelues in a place of aduantage, and hard of acceſſe, incloſed with thicke hedges and bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, diſturbed and ouerthrew with their archers at the firſt onſet the French horſemen, and wounded moſt of their men and horſes with multitude of arrowes: it tarried not long ere the footmen alſo were put to flight on the other ſide, &amp; the whole army of threeſcore thouſand men, by bare eight thouſand Engliſh, diſcomfited: diuers great lords were found ſlaine in the field, and diuers others with the king himſelfe carried priſoners into England: which was a great ſhake to the whole Realme, and the occaſion of many tumults and diſorders that enſued afterwards.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, as it is a raſh part to hazard the doubtfull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent of battaile indiſcretely, and without cauſe, ſo it is a point of no leſſe folly to thruſt ones ſelfe voluntarily into any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of war without charge, not being particularly called and

They as fooliſh as himſelfe, not willing to croſſe his mind, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to looſe him in the preaſe, tied him faſt to the raines of their bridles, being by this meanes ſo coupled togither, as if they meant al to periſh togither if need were, as indeed they did, for they were ouercome in battaile, and the next day found all dead, horſe and men, faſt bound togither. This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident befell at Crecy neare Abreuile, in which iourney the French king ſuſtained an ineſtimable dammage, for hee loſt fifteene of his chiefeſt princes, foureſcore enſigns, twelue hundred knights, and about thirty thouſand men.</p>

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:1241:153"/> deſtroied the huge vnchriſtened multitude of his enemies: for albeit the Bohemians being placed in the rereward, were as ſuddenly and vnexpectedly aſſaulted by the enemy that craftily paſſed ouer the riuer Lycus to ſet vpon them behind, as vnhappily put to flight with the loſſe of the carriages and vittailes, which they were ſet to protect; yet <hi>Otto</hi> with his other legions renuing the battell and encouraging his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, gaue the enemy ſuch an encounter and repulſe, that he put them to flight, and ſlew them with a miſerable ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: three of their kings hee tooke priſoners, and few of that vaſt army eſcaped with their liues. On the Emperours ſide died many worthy men, among whome, <hi>Conrade</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours ſonne in law, and <hi>Burghard</hi> duke of Sueuia were two, beſide many other. In this ſucceſsiue battaile it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aboue the reſt, how religiouſly the Emperor both began and finiſhed it: the day before the fight, he inioyned a faſt in his army, and directed his praiers to the Almighty, relying more vpon the preſence of Gods helpe, than his owne pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: After the conqueſt gotten, he cauſed ſolemne thankes to be giuen in all Churches to God for that great deliuerance.

                  </note> The ſecond bringeth the teſtimony of one <hi>Appianus,</hi> that affirmed himſelfe to haue ſeene at Rome a lyon, who for old acquaintance ſake which he had with a condemned ſeruant, fawned vpon him, and cleared him in like manner from the fury of the other beaſts; the hiſtory was this:</p>
               <p>A certaine bondſlaue, too roughly handled by his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, forſooke him, and fled away, and in his flight retiring into a deſart, and not knowing how to beſtow himſelfe, tooke vp a caue for his lodging, where hee had not long abode, but a mightie lyon came halting to his denne, with a ſore and bloody legge: the poore ſlaue all forgone at this ſtrange and ougly ſight, looked euery minute to be deuoured, but the lyon in another moode came fawningly and ſoftly tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards him, as if he would complaine vnto him of his griefe: whereat (ſomewhat heartened) hee bethought himſelfe to apply ſome medecine to his wound, and to bind vp the ſore as well as he could, which hee had no ſooner done, but the lyon made out for his prey, and ere long returning, brought home to his hoſt and ſurgeon certaine gobbets of raw fleſh, which he halfe roſting vpon a rocke by the ſunne beames, made his daily ſuſtenance, for the time of his abode there: notwithſtanding at length wearied with this odde &amp; ſauage

Thus God reprooueth the ſauadge inhumanitie of men, by the example of the wild and furious beaſts, at whoſe teeth poore ſeruants found more fauor, than at their maſters hands.</p>
               <p>The Emperour <hi>Constantine,</hi> weighing the indignitie of theſe and ſuch like paſtimes, and knowing how farre they ought to be baniſhed from the ſociety of men, by a publike edict aboliſhed all ſuch bloody and monſtrous ſpectacles.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y this which hath beene ſpoken it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth manifeſtly, how infamous a thing it is among Chriſtians to priuiledge and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low publike places for adulteries, albeit it is a common thing in the greateſt ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Europe, yea and in the very bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of Chriſtendome, where no ſuch vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanie ſhould be tollerated. There is nothing that can caſt any coulor of excuſe vpon it, ſeeing it is expreſſely contrarie to Gods edict in many places, as firſt: Thou ſhalt not commit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie. And in the 19 of Leuit. 29. Thou ſhalt not pollute thy daughter in proſtituting her to be a whore, leaſt the land bee defiled with whoredome, and filled with wickedneſſe. And in Deut. 23.17. Let there bee no whore of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Iſraell, neither a whorekeeper of the ſonnes of Iſrael: this is the decree of God, and the rule which hee hath giuen vs to ſquare our affections by, and it admitteth no diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But ſome doe obiect that thoſe things are tollerated to auoid greater miſchiefes: as though the Lord were not well aduiſed when he gaue forth thoſe commandements, or that mortall men had more diſcretion than the immortall God. This truly is nothing els but to reiect and diſanull that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> requireth as a duty of al Chriſtians:<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.</note> namely, That fornication and all vncleanneſſe ſhould not once be named a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, neither filthineſſe, fooliſh talking, or ieaſting, which are things not comely; for ſo much as no whoremonger, nor vncleane perſon can haue any inheritance in the kingdome of God.<note place="margin">

How farre were they then from giuing leaue and libertie for filthie and ſtinking brothel-houſes to bee erected and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained? In this therefore the very Heathen are a ſhame and reproch to thoſe that call themſelues Chriſtians and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques. Beſides, the goodly reaſon which they alledge for their vpholding of their ſtewes is ſo farre from the truth, that the contrarie is euer truer, namely that by their odious and diſhoneſt libertie more euill ariſeth to the world, than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would, in ſo much as it ſetteth open a wide dore to al diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſſe and whoredomes, &amp; an occaſion of lecherie and vncleanneſſe euen to thoſe that otherwiſe would abſtaine from all ſuch filthie actions. How many young folke are there, aſwell men as women, that by this means giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ouer to looſeneſſe, and vndoe themſelues vtterly? how many murthers are, haue beene, and ſtill will bee committed thereby? What a diſorder, confuſion, and ignomie of nature is it, for a father to lie with her with whom his ſon had been but a little before? Or the ſonne to come after the father? and ſuch like: but by the iuſt iudgement of God it commeth to paſſe that that which is thought to be encloſed within the precincts of certaine appointed places, ſpreadeth it ſelfe at large ſo farre, that oftentimes whole ſtreetes and cities are poyſoned; yea euen their houſes, who in regard of their place either in the law or pollicie, ought to ſtop the ſtreame of ſuch vices: nay which is more meruaile, they that with open mouth vaunt themſelues to bee Gods Leiutenants on earth, Chriſts vicars, and ſucceſſors to his Apoſtles, are ſo filthie and abhominable, as to ſuffer publicke bauds and whores to be vnder their noſes vncontrouled; and which is more, to enrich their treaſures by their traffique. <hi>Cornelius Agrippa</hi> ſaith, that of all the hee-bauds of his time, Pope <hi>Sextus</hi> was moſt infamous, for hee builded a moſt glorious and ſtately
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:1241:165"/> Stues (if any ſtate or glorie can abide in ſo bad a place) aſwell for common Adulterie, as vnnaturall Sodomy, to bee exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in. Hee vſed (as <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> was wont to doe) to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain heards of whores with whom he participated his friends and ſeruants as they ſtood in need; and by Adulteries reared yearely great reuenues into his purſe. <hi>Baleus</hi> ſayth, that at this day euery whore in Rome paies tribute to the Pope, a Iulle, which amounted then to twentie thouſand dukats by the yeare at leaſt, but now the number is ſo encreaſed that it ariſeth to fortie thouſand.

Again beſides the euill example which is exhibited, there is this miſchiefe moreouer, that the children of ſuch a bed cannot bee eſteemed legitimate, yea and God himſelf accurſeth ſuch lawleſſe familiaritie, as the miſchieues that ariſe therefrom doe declare, whereof this one example which we alledge ſhall ſerue for ſufficient proofe.</p>
               <p>In the raigne of <hi>Lewis</hi> the ninth king of France, and <hi>Iulius</hi> the ſecond Pope of Rome, there was a Gentleman of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples called <hi>Antonio Bologne</hi> that had beene gouernour of <hi>Fredericke</hi> of Arragons houſe when hee was king of Naples, and had the ſame office vnder the Ducheſſe of <hi>Malfi</hi> after ſhe was widdow, with whom in protract of time, hee grew to haue ſuch ſecret and priuie acquaintance (albeit ſhee was a Princeſſe and he her ſeruant) that he enioied her as his owne wife. And thus they conuerſed ſecretly togither vnder cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of marriage accorded betwixt them, the ſpace of certaine yeares, vntill ſhee bore vnto him three children: by which meanes, their priuate dealings which they ſo much deſired to ſmother and keepe cloſe, burſt out and bewraied it ſelfe. The matter being come to her brothers eares, they tooke it ſo to the heart, that they could not reſt, vntill they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged the vile iniurie &amp; diſhonor which they pretended to haue ben done to them &amp; their whole houſe, equally by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both. Therefore when they had chaſed them firſt from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cona, whether in hope of quietnes they had fled out of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, they draue them alſo out of Tuſcane: who ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues purſued ſo hotely on euery ſide, reſolued to make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Venice, thinking there to find ſome ſafetie: But in the midway ſhee was ouertaken and brought backe to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, where in ſhort ſpace ſhee miſerably ended her life: For her brothers guard ſtrangled her to death, together with her chambermaid, who had ſerued in ſtead of a baud to them; and her poore infants which ſhee had by the ſaid <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne.</hi> But he by the goodneſſe of his horſe eſcaping, tooke his flight to Millaine, where hee ſoiourned quietly a long
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:1241:166"/> while, vntill at the inſtant purſuit of one of her brothers, the Cardinall of Arragon, he was ſlaine in the open ſtreets, when he leaſt miſtruſted any preſent danger. And this was a true Cardinal-like exploit indeed, repreſenting that mildneſſe, mercifulneſſe, and good nature which is ſo required of euery Chriſtian, in traiterous murthering a man ſo many yeres after the firſt rancour was conceiued, that might well in halfe that ſpace haue beene digeſted, in foſtering hatred ſo long in his cruell heart, and waging ruffians and murtherers to commit ſo monſtrous an act: wherein albeit the Cardinals crueltie was moſt famous, as alſo in putting to death the poore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, yet Gods iuſtice bare the ſway, that vſed him as an inſtrument to puniſh thoſe, who vnder the vaile of ſecret marriage, thought it lawfull for them to commit any villany.

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:1241:167"/> the Apoſtle ſaith, That marriage is honourable among all men, and the bed vndefiled; but whoremongers and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers God will iudge. But they haue it not in that eſtimation, ſeeing by authority they are depriued of the vſe thereof, and not of adultery. That which is honeſt and laudable is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and that which is ſinnefull and vnlawfull, allowed of. This (ſaith <hi>Sleidan</hi>) is the cuſtome of the Germane biſhops,<note place="margin">

Neither was it without reaſon that <hi>Iohn le Maire</hi> ſaid, How vnder the ſhew and colour of chaſtity, prieſts whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes did ouerflow, beeing men abandoned to all diſſolute and riotous liuing. Now then it were farre better to marrie than to burne, yet in ſuch ſort to marry, that all giddineſſe and inconſideration ſet aſide, euery one ſhould match him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe according to his degree and age, with great reſpect and good aduiſement had vnto them both, to the end to auoid thoſe miſchiefes and enormities which oftentimes happen, when either by an ouer hardy, fooliſh, and raſh preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a man would neſtle himſelfe in an higher neſt than his eſtate and calling requireth, or by a ſenſuall and fleſhly luſt paſsing the bounds of reaſon, goeth about to conſtraine, and interrupt the law of nature. The chiefeſt thing that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in marriage, is the conſent of parties, as well of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues that are to be ioyned togither, as of each of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; the contrary whereof is conſtraint, where either par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is forced:<note place="margin">Iudg. 21.</note> as it happened to thoſe two hundred maides, which the Beniamites tooke by force and violence to be their wiues.</p>
               <p>This was a reproch to <hi>Romulus,</hi> the firſt king of Rome, when hee rauiſhed the Sabine virgins that came to ſee their
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:1241:167"/> ſports, which was cauſe of great warre betwixt them. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, beſides the mutuall ioynt of loue which ought to be betwixt man and wife, it is neceſſary that they that marrie, doe marry in the Lord, to ſerue him in greater puritie, and with leſſe diſturbance; which can not be, if a Chriſtian mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie an infidell, for the great difficulties and hinderances that vſually ſpring from ſuch a roote.<note place="margin">Exod. 34 16, Deut. 7 3.</note> Therefore it was ſtraightly forbidden the people of God to contract mariages with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latours; yea, and the holy Patriarchs before any ſuch law was giuen, had carefully great regard (in the marriages of their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) to this thing, as the example of <hi>Abraham</hi> doth ſufficiently declare. Therefore they that haue any manner of gouernment and authority ouer vnmarried folkes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be fathers, mothers, kinſmen, or tutours, ought to haue eſpeciall care and regard thereof. Yea Chriſtian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and lords or rulers of commonwealths, ſhould not in this reſpect be ſo ſupine and negligent in the performance of their offices, as once to permit and ſuffer this amongſt them, which is ſo directly contrary to the word of God; but rather by eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall charge forbid it, to the end, that both their lawes might be conformable, and in euery reſpect agreeable to the holy ordinances of God, and that the way might be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to thoſe miſchiefes, which were likely to ariſe from ſuch euill concluded marriages. For what reaſon is it, that a yong maide, baptized and brought vp in the Church of Chriſt, ſhould bee giuen in marriage to a worſhipper of images and idols, and ſent to ſuch a countrey where the worſhip of God is not ſo much as once thought vpon? Is not this to plucke a ſoule out of the houſe of God, and thruſt it into the houſe of the deuill? out of heauen into hell? than which, what greater Apoſtaſie or falling from God can there be? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all they are guilty that either make vp ſuch marriages, or giue their good will and conſent to them, or doe not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cauſe and proceedings of them, if any manner of way they can. Now that this confuſion and mixture of religion in marriages is vnpleaſant and noiſome to God, it manifeſtly
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:1241:168"/> appeareth by the ſixt chapter of Geneſis, where it is ſaid, That becauſe the ſonnes of God, [to wit, thoſe whome God had ſeparated for himſelfe from the beginning of the world to be his peculiar ones,] were ſo euill aduiſed, as to be allured with the beauties of the daughters of men, [to wit, of thoſe which were not choſen of God to be his people; and to marry with them, corrupting themſelues by this contagious acquaintance of prophane people, with whome they ſhould haue had nothing to doe,] that therefore God was incenſed againſt them, and reſolued ſimply to reuenge the wickednes of ech party without reſpect. Beſide, the monſtrous fruits of thoſe prophane marriages, doe ſufficiently declare their odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes in Gods ſight: for from them aroſe gyants of ſtrength and ſtature exceeding the proportion of men, who by their hugenes did much wrong and violence in the world, and gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned fearefull &amp; terrible names to themſelues: but God (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked by their oppreſsions) drowned their tyrannies in the flood, and made an end of the world for their ſakes. In the time of the Iudges in Iſrael, the Iſraelites were chaſtiſed by the hand of God for this ſame fault; for they tooke to wiues the daughters of the vncircumciſed, and gaue them their daughters alſo.<note place="margin">Iudg. 3.</note> In like ſort framed they themſelues by this means to their corrupt manners and ſuperſtitions, and to the ſeruice of their idolatrous Gods: But the Lord of heauen rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned downe anger vpon their heads, and made them ſubiect to a ſtranger, the king of Meſopotamia, whome they ſerued the ſpace of eight yeeres.<note place="margin">1.

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:1241:169"/> after continuance of time, began to aduiſe himſelfe, and to conſult whether this marriage with his brothers wife might be lawfull or no; and found it by conference both of holy and prophane lawes, vtterly vnlawfull: whereupon hee ſent certain biſhops to the Queene to giue her to know, That the Popes diſpenſation was altogither vniuſt, and of none effect to priuiledge ſuch an act: to whome ſhee anſwered, that it was too late to call in queſtion the Popes bull which ſo long time they had allowed of. The two Cardinals that were in Commiſsion from the Pope to decide the controuerſie, and to award iudgement vpon the matter, were once vpon point to conclude the decree, which the king deſired, had not the Pope impeached their determination in regard of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Charles,</hi> nephew to the ſaid Queene, whome hee was loth to diſpleaſe: wherefore the king ſeeing himſelfe fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate of his purpoſe in this behalfe, ſent into diuers coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to know the iudgement of all the learned Diuines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the matter in controuerſie, who (eſpecially thoſe that dwelt not farre off) ſeemed to allow and approoue the diuorce: thereupon hee reſolued (reiecting his old wife) to take him to a new, and to marry (as he did) <hi>Anne</hi> of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine one of the Queenes maids of honour, a woman of moſt rare and excellent beauty. Now as touching his firſt marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with his brothers wife how vnfortunate it was in it owne nature, and how vniuſtly diſpenſed withall by the Pope, we ſhall anon ſee, by thoſe heauie, ſorrowfull, and troubleſome euents and iſſues which immediatly followed in the necke thereof.</p>
               <p>And firſt and foremoſt of the euill fare of the Cardinall of Yorke, with whome the king beeing highly diſpleaſed, for that at his inſtance and requeſt, the Pope had oppoſed himſelfe to this marriage, requited him (and not vndeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedly) on this manner: Firſt he depoſed him from the office of the Chancellourſhip: ſecondly, depriued him of two of his three biſhopricks which he held: &amp; laſtly, ſent him packing
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:1241:170"/> to his owne houſe, as one whom hee neuer purpoſed more to ſee. Yet afterward being aduertiſed of certaine inſolent and threatning ſpeeches which hee vſed againſt him, hee ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine for him: but he not daring to refuſe to come at his call, died in the way with meere griefe, and deſpight. The Pope gaue his definitiue ſentence againſt this act, and fauoured the cauſe of the diuorced ladie: But what gained hee by it? ſaue onely that the king offended with him, reiected him and all his trumperie, retaining his yearely tribute leuied out of this realme, and conuerted it to another vſe; and this was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of his goodly diſpenſation with an inceſtuous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: wherein although to ſpeake truly and properly he loſt nothing of his owne, yet it was a deepe checke and no ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low loſſe to him and his ſucceſſors to be depriued of ſo good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a reuenue, and ſo great authoritie in this realme, as hee then was.</p>

Out of the ſame fountaine ſprang the words of Queen <hi>Hecuba</hi> in <hi>Euripides</hi> ſpeaking to <hi>Menelaus</hi> as touching <hi>Helen,</hi> when ſhe admoniſhed him to enact this law, That euery wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which ſhould betray her husbands credit, and her owne chaſtitie to another man, ſhould die the death.</p>
               <p>In old time the Aegyptians vſed to puniſh adultery on this ſort, the man with a thouſand ierkes with a reed,<note place="margin">Diodor.</note> and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with cutting off her noſe; but hee that forced a free wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to his luſt, had his priuie members cut off.

Yea and at this day amongſt the very Turkes and Tartarians, this ſinne is ſharply puniſhed. So that

Beſide all this, to the end this ſinne might not be ſhuffled vp and kept cloſe, there was a meanes giuen, whereby if a man did but ſuſpect his wife for this ſin, though ſhee could by no witnes or proofe be conuinced, her wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe notwithſtanding moſt ſtrangely and extraordinarily might be diſcouered.<note place="margin">Numb. 5.</note> And it was this: The woman publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at her husbands ſute, called in queſtion before the prieſt, who was to giue iudgement of her after diuers ceremonies and circumſtances perfourmed, and bitter curſes pronounced by him, her belly would burſt, and her thigh would rot, if ſhee were guilty, and ſhe ſhould be a curſe amongſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for her ſinne; but if ſhe was free, no euill would come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her. Thus it pleaſed God to make knowne, that the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of thoſe that are polluted with this ſinne, ſhould not lie hid. This may more clearely appeare by the example of the Leuites wife, of whome it is ſpoken in the 19, 20, and 21 chapters of Iudges, who hauing forſaken her husband to play the whore, certaine moneths after hee had againe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued her to be his wife, ſhe was giuen ouer againſt her will to the villanous and monſtrous luſts of the moſt wicked and peruerſe Gibeonites,<note place="margin">Rape, <hi>li.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 19.</note> that ſo abuſed her for the ſpace of a whole night togither, that in the morning ſhee was found dead vpon the threſhold, which thing turned to a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and ouerthrow in Iſrael; for the Leuit, when hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, and found his wife newly dead at the dore of his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,

In the Dukedome of Spoleto which is the way from Ancona to Rome (of the ancient Latines called Vmbria) there were three brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who kept in their poſſeſsion three cities of the ſaid dukedome, namely Faligno, Nocera, and Treuio, the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of whom whoſe ſirname was <hi>Nicholas,</hi> as he paſſed from one town to the other, being at Nocera, lodged diuers times in the caſtell in the keepers and captaines houſe, whome hee had there ſubſtituted to defend the place with an ordinary band of ſouldiors: now as he made his abode there a few daies, hee grew to caſt a more laſciuious eie vpon the captains wife than was meet, and from looking fell to luſting after her, in ſuch ſort that in ſhort ſpace hee got very priuy &amp; familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with her, &amp; oftentimes ſecret, &amp; ſuſpicious mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: which being perceiued by her husband, he after wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſo narrowly their haunts, that once hee ſpied the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without being ſeen of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Neuertheleſſe diſgeſting and ſwallowing vp this ſorrow with ſilence, and without giuing forth any tokens therof, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſulted in himſelf to reuenge the iniury by the death &amp; raſing out, not only of the Adulterer, but alſo of the whole race &amp; fraternity. Now when hee had hammered this enterpriſe &amp; laid forth the plot thereof in his head, he diſpatched preſently a meſſenger to the three gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to inuite the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt the next day to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the faireſt wild bore that was this many a day ſeene in the forreſts of Nocera.

And this was the cataſtrophe of that wofull tragedy, where by the

And thus God reuenged the extortion and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie of that age.</p>
               <p>But yet for all this thoſe ſinnes were not then ſo defaced and rooted vp, but that they be burniſhed againe and grown in time to as big a Bulke: for euen at this day the greateſt part of the world is giuen to practiſe fraud and deceit, and by vnlawfull meanes to encroch vpon others goods; which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleties, though they deſire neuer ſo to diſguiſe and cloke, yet will they euer bee condemned &amp; reputed kinds of theft before God: now as ſome are of greater power and authority than others in the world, ſo anſwerable to their ſelues is the qualitie of their ſinnes, and by conſequence the puniſhment: the greater of power, the greater theeues and the greater iudgement: for if a poor man through pouerty and neceſsity cutteth a purſe, of ſtealeth any other trifle, be culpable; how much more culpable ſhall he that is rich bee, that vſurpeth the goods of his neighbor?</p>

<pb n="387" facs="tcp:1241:198"/> allow and agree vpon, and which a man with a ſafe conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may put in practiſe:] for the former we can haue no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſchoolmaſter nor inſtruction, ſaue the holy ſcripture, wherein God hath manifeſted his will vnto vs, concerning this very matter, as in <hi>Deuteronom.</hi> 18, ſpeaking of the office and duty of a king, he forbiddeth them to be horders vp of gold and ſiluer, and eſpouſers of many wiues, and louers of pride; ſignifying thereby, that they ought to containe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues within the bounds of modeſtie and temperance, and not giue the raines to their owne affections, nor heape vp great treaſures to their peoples detriment, nor to delight in warre, nor to be too much ſubiect to their owne pleaſures; all which things are meanes of vnmeaſurable expenſe: ſo that if it be not allowable to muſter togither multitudes of goods, for the danger and miſchiefe that enſueth thereof, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth out of this place; then ſurely is it much leſſe law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to leuy exceſsiue taxes of the people; for the one of theſe can not be without the other: and thus for the law of God it is cleare, that by it authority is not committed vnto them, to ſurcharge, and as it were, trample downe their poore ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, by vnmeaſurable and vnſupportable impoſition.</p>
               <p>As for that which the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> in the name of God, giueth notice to the Iſraelites of, touching the right of a king; wherein he ſeemeth to allow him the diſpoſition of the goods and perſons of his ſubiects: I anſwer firſt, that God being an immooueable truth, cannot contradict himſelfe by commanding and forbidding the ſame thing; and ſecondly, that the word of the text in the originall, ſignifieth nothing elſe, but a cuſtome, or faſhion, as it appeareth in the 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.13: beſides, the ſpeech that the Prophet vſeth, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not a commandement, but an aduertiſement of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, whereunto the people were about to thruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, by deſiring a king after the manner of other nations, whoſe cuſtomes amongſt them, was to exerciſe authority and dominion as well ouer their goods as their perſons: for which cauſe, God would haue them forewarned, that they might

               <p>Furthermore, that a king in Iſrael had no power (in right and equity) to take away the poſſeſsions of any of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and appropriate it to himſelfe, it appeareth by <hi>Nabaoths</hi> refuſal to king <hi>Achab,</hi>

Now how odious a thing before God, the oppreſsion of poore people is, it is manifeſt by his owne words in the propheſie of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> where hee ſaith,<note place="margin">Chap. 15.9.</note>

               <p>Neither truly doth the iuſtice of God ſleep in this reſpect, but taketh vengeance vpon all ſuch, and puniſheth them after one ſort or other, either in body or goods, as it pleaſeth him: I my ſelf knew a grand vſurer in the country of Vallay that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſcraped togither great maſſes of gold &amp; ſiluer by theſe vnlawful means, was in one night robbed of fifteene hundred crownes by theeues, that broke into his houſe. I remember alſo another Vſurer dwelling in a Towne called Argentall, nigh vnto Anouay vnder the iuriſdiction of Tholoſſe in high Viuaria, who being in hay time in a medow, was ſtong in the

               <p>The ſame Author telleth of another Vſurer, that a little before his death called for his bags of gold and ſiluer, and offered them al to his ſoule, vpon condition it would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him: but if hee would haue giuen all the world it could not ranſome him from death, wherefore when hee ſaw there was no remedie but hee muſt needes die, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his ſoule to the deuill to bee carried into euerlaſting torments, which wordes when hee had vttered hee gaue vp the ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Another Vſurer being ready to die, made this his laſt Will and teſtament: My ſoule (quoth he) I bequeath to the Deuill who is owner of it; my wife likewiſe to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill who induced mee to this vngodly trade of life;<note place="margin">Iohannes.

               <p>The bold anſwer of an old woman to the Emperour <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> is very worthy to be remembred;<note place="margin">Fulgoſ. lib. <hi>6.</hi> cap. <hi>2.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Ierem. 9. Pſal. 5.</note> A God that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not iniquitie, with whom the wicked cannot dwell, nor the fooles ſtand before his preſence. It is hee that hateth the workers of vnrighteouſneſſe, and that deſtroieth the liers, &amp; abhorreth all deceitfull, diſloiall, periurous &amp; murdering per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as with him there is no acception of perſons, ſo none of what eſtate or condition ſoeuer, be they rich or poor, noble or ignoble, gentle or carterlike, can exempt themſelues from his wrath and indignation when it is kindled but a little,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.9.</note> if they delight and continue in their ſinnes; for as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation &amp; anguiſh is vpon the ſoule of euery man that doth euill.</p>
               <pb n="467" facs="tcp:1241:239"/>
               <p>Now according to the variety and diuerſity of mens offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Lord in his moſt iuſt and admirable iudgement, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth diuerſity of puniſhments: ſometimes correcting them one by one in particular, other whiles altogither in a heape; ſometimes by ſtormes and tempeſts both by ſea and land, other times by lightning, haile, and deluge of waters; often by ouerflowing and breaking out of riuers, and of the ſea alſo; and not ſeldome by remedileſſe and ſudden fires, heauen &amp; earth and all the elements beeing armed with an inuincible force, to take vengeance vpon ſuch as are traitors and rebels againſt God: ſundry times he ſcourgeth the world (as it well deſerueth) with his vſuall and accuſtomed plagues, namely of warre, and famine, and peſtilence, which are euident ſignes of his anger, according to the threats denounced in the law touching the ſame: and therefore if at any time he defer the puniſhment of the wicked, it is for no other end, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the fulneſſe of their ſinne, and to make them more inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, when contrary to his bountifulneſſe and long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring (which inuiteth and calleth them to repentance) they harden themſelues and grow more obſtinate in their vices and rebellion, drawing vpon their heads the whole heape of wrath the more grieuouſly to aſſaile them. And thus the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God marcheth but a ſoft pace (as ſaith <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi>) to the end to double and aggrauate the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the ſlackneſſe thereof.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hich ſeeing it is ſo, it is neceſſary that the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and peruerſe ones ſhould feele the rigor of Gods wrath for the preſumption and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion wherewith they daily prouoke him againſt them: and although with thoſe that feare God, and ſtriue to keepe themſelues from euill, and take paines to liue peaceably and quietly, it often times goeth worſe here below than with others, being laid open to millions of iniuries, reproches, and cruelties, and are as it were ſheepe appointed to the ſlaughter; whereof ſome are maſſacred, ſome hanged, ſome hedded, ſome drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſome burned, or put to ſome other cruell death: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their eſtate and condition is farre happier than that of the wicked, for ſo much as all their ſufferings and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities are bleſſed and ſanctified vnto them of God, who turneth them to their aduantage, according to the ſaying of S. <hi>Luke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.28.</note> 
                  <hi>That all things worke for the good to them that feare God:</hi> for whatſoeuer tribulation befalleth them, they cannot be ſeparated from the loue of God, which hee beareth vnto them in his well beloued ſonne Chriſt Ieſus: be it then that God viſiteth them for their faults (for there is none that is cleare of ſinne) it is a fatherly chaſtiſement, to bring them to amendment: be it that he exerciſeth them by many afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as he did <hi>Iob,</hi> it is to prooue their faith and patience, to the end they may be better purified like gold in the furnace, and ſerue for examples to others. If it be for the truth of the Goſpell that they ſuffer, then they are bleſſed, becauſe they are conformed to the image of the ſonne of God, that they might alſo be partakers of his glory, for they that ſuffer with him, are aſſured to raigne with him: hence it is, that in the
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:1241:241"/> midſt of their torments and oppreſsions, in the midſt of fires and fagots flaming about them, beeing comforted with the conſolations of Gods ſpirit through a ſure hope of their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie repoſe and incorruptible crowne which is prepared for them in the heauens, they reioice and are ſo chearefull: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe the wicked, ſeeing themſelues enſnared in the euils which their owne ſinnes brought vpon them, gnaſh their teeth, fret themſelues, murmure againſt God, and hlaſpheme him, like wretches, to their endleſſe perdition. There is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore great difference betwixt the puniſhments of ech of theſe, for the one tendeth to honour and life, the other to ſhame and confuſion: and euen as it is not the greatnes of torments that maketh the martyr, but the goodnes of the cauſe; ſo the infliction of puniſhment vniuſtly, neither maketh the partie afflicted guilty, nor any whit diminiſheth his reputation: wheras the wicked that are iuſtly tormented for their ſinnes, are ſo marked with infamie and diſhonour, that the ſtaine thereof can neuer be wiped out.</p>
               <p>Let euery one therefore learne to keepe himſelfe from euill, and to containe himſelfe in a kind of modeſtie and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie of life, ſeeing that by the plagues and ſcourges where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the world is ordinarily afflicted, Gods fierce wrath is clearely reuealed from heauen vpon all impiety and iniuſtice of men, to conſume all thoſe that rebell againſt him. Thinke vpon this you inhabitants of the earth, ſmall and great, of what qualitie or condition ſoeuer you be.</p>
               <p>If you be mighty, puiſſant, and fearfull, know that the Lord is greater tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you; for he is almighty, all-terrible, &amp; al-feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; in what place ſoeuer you are, he is alwaies aboue you, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to hurle you downe and ouerturne you, to breake, quaſh, &amp; cruſh you in pieces as pots of earth; he is armed with thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, fire, and a bloody ſword to deſtroy, conſume, and cut you in peeces: heauen threatneth from aboue, and the earth which you trample on from below, ſhaking vnder your feet, and being ready to ſpue you out from her face, or ſwallow you vp in her bowels: in briefe, all the elements &amp; creatures
